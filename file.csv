analyze existing programs to see whether they should be reduced or eliminated, in accordance with over-all objectives, and the personnel resources thus released applied to new or higher priority projects.","for instance, those who are no lotiger capable of ler­forlmigr combat service, and who should be assigned to slore duity f any icind that will not tax their physical capability.","in july 1951 we not only froze existing ceilings, but directed a 5-percent cut in both military and civilian personnel be made by october 1951.

in brief, the 1953 budget program will provide initial equipment and supply levels for the additional forces to be built up during the year; peacetime con­
sumption of the expanded force during the year; and some war reserves, vary­ing in amount between items but with emphasis on ordnance and ordnance items.","the increase in production is exemplified by the fact that department of for a doubling of hard goods and construction between

you realize that with a national product of $320 billion, which was 
not long ago estimated to be the national product for 1952, the de­
partment of defense expenditures, which were estimated to be about $40 billion, would be about 12.3 percent of the national product.","cost of war in korea

on february 28, 1949, the bureau of the budget approved a draft of the 
enabling legislation for submission to congress jointly by the national military 
establishment and by the naca.","he felt that the fee of about $1.5 million-that would be the-amount the aro corporation should have to spend if he retained there the people, the military and civilian people he already had, and the ones he expected to get.","these cost a considerable sum, and they were doing what i considered were the functions that should have been carried out in part by the aro corp. 
1 was endeavorilir to get the aro corp. to take over more of those duties so we could use the military and the civil service people where they are urgent tly needed, and where i canot get them to carry out the functions.",the purpose is to cut down the overhead on the military personnel.,"we want to present for your committee a matter which i am sure is in the back of your minds, and that is the question of how to reduce the cost of producing military equipment.","i gave about, a year's study to this work, and last year, on january 9, 1951, i presented the department of defense a copy of this article under the subject broad approach to the cost of major equipment, for the united states department of defense.","i iust want to read a very short paragal)h or two frxm this statement, ""factors affecting the cost of military equip­ment.""","second, cost per pound of military load and equipment carried, which gives efficiency of design: and 
third, cost per pound of striking power against the enemy, and that is the military part of it that cannot be done by the civilian.","after the battle of the bulge they realized they had to (roto the christie system, and i think it cost several hundred mil­lion dollars to revalnp the tanks in their program, and the boys in korea are getting a few of them.","i know we were building machines during the war that cost $2.5,000 to $30,000, and today they are asking $250,000 for about the same thing.","in the military services, however, the expenditures involved in inventories and in personnel engaged in the functional area of storage and issue are so tre­lnendous that even a small percentagewise saving will represent many millions of dollars.","on january 13, 1949, in accordance with my request, the assistant secretary of defense sent me a-report on the cost of these functions, including publishing costs for fiscal years 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1950. for some strange reason, the navy department could not include their figures for standardization, packaging, and the preparation of spec­ifications.","assuming that these figures would be approximately the same as the army figures, and if these estimated figures are included, the cost of preparing and publishing this catalog data within the de­partment of defense for 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1950""-4 years-would .be over $140 millions.. these same functions have been carried on since 1929. today, in fiscal year 1953, these functions are, still being carried on, and recently in hearings before the hmbert subcommittee the congress has been advised that five more years would be required for the completion of the catalog.","however, assuming that it is only 10 percent and if the same proportion of savings is true today, then there could be saved out of the present $52-billion defense budget over $5 billion.","things, nor is the committee adequately staffed, when you think of considering a $52 billion military budget.","it can have some effect, but it has been my observation that the military people spend their money along certain procedures: whether much or little, the same ele­ments of procedure are followed, anid if we could achieve economy and efficiency through good management, we might be able to cut 10, 5, or $1 billion out of this bill.","you are up against this proposition, that if yqu cut out the military public relations man, and if you do not reduce the size of the army, the navy, or the air force, you have not saved any money by such operation, if they are simply shifted to another branch of the service, unless they are sent.to some place where they would be performing more effective employment.","let me ask you this: would you suggest that we reduce the number of people in uniform below the budget estimate, and direct that this reduction be made in the military personnel; or would you just cut them out, try to cut out the people themselves, and have them 
assigned to other duties?","in view of the fact that the fellows who have been fighting and who may soon again be fighting in korea draw no pay for special hazards, no extra pay for special hazards, would it not be fair and a wise economy to cut out the flight pay and special hazard pay?","if we cannot spend weeks and years working on military budgets and figuring out ways to make suitable reductions, it might well be asked, ""how could we expect you to know how to make suitable reductions?""",you are interested in how much of a cut can be made in the present military budget.,i say this with full knowledge that any cut is a. decision of policy affecting the striking force of the military establishment.,"i believe such a cut, instead of rendering the military less effective, will actually result in improvement of the end products of our national-defense efforts; namely, combat strength.","it costs $1,000 per man to maintain these troops in trieste.","anybody who has ever visited one of these military commercial operations, and who has ever had any business experience can tell that they just simply cannot operate in competition to private business, because they do not consider in their overhead cost and so forth all of the things which private business has to consider.",i )ear mr. chairm.an: reference is made to your letter dated march 7 re­que.triwi information as to the amount of funds contained in the fiscal year 1953 air force budget estimate for transportation of dependents and household goods oif military personnel and the rules and regulations governing the same.,"fiscal year 1953 fund requirements for transportation of dependents and household goods of air force personnel were computed on the basis of the estimated number of military personnel who will be directed to perform a per­

our troops into the field.","the navy has advised, so we were told, all the services, that those machine tools were available; and knowing of the critical shortage of machine tools in this country, if there is any request for funds on the part of the military for machine tools, these tools are available, and a reasonable estimate of their acquisition given to the committee at adak was $1 million.","when we asked the military what was included in their cost accounting, we found that no amortiza­tion of the machinery was included or rent of the building was in­cluded, and that heat and light were not inchlded.","one of the great things about the american economy is our dis­tributive system, and yet if the military buys 10,000 hammers direct from a factory at 60 cents a hammer, they say they save a lot of money because it would cost them $1 a hammer if they were bought at the retail hardware store.","i said ""in other words, you people are the ones who are really screening the military budget for what they really need and not the congressional appropriations comnittee.""",for your information a set of my tables with respect to military appropriations and expenditures is enclosed.,"i realize of course that some of the suggestions, especially with respect to limitations on expenditures from prior authorizations in the case of the military, cannot be accomplished by ordinary action on regular appropriation bills alone.","enclosures

considerable study of the problem, as no doubt you should have in your important capacity with the government, and that you had given some consideration to what could be done maybe on a higher budget than $50 billion, and what could be done, possibly, with a budget in the range of $50 billion.","i am pleased to meet with you gentlemen to discuss some of the 
general factors underlying the recent considerations of the military 
budget.","the decisions on the military budget are of basic importance 
to the mobilization program, as the military program is the central 
driving force in our mobilization effort.","i understand that my function here today is to provide you gentle­
men with some of the policy issues and resource facts which were 
before the mobilization agencies when the question of the size and 
55 

character of the military budget was under active discussion some 
weeks ago.",my second point bears more specifically on the 1953 military budget.,"i have never said, nor would i want this committee to feel, that our current military effort or the military effort envisioned in the 1953 budget is the maxi­mum which this country could do.","finally, i have been concerned throughout the entire discussion of the military budget levels that we not lose the momentum we have attempted to build up to place production, particularly on the long lead-time items, on a sharply rising curve.","therefore, for the calendar year 1952, and on some items even beyond that, we cannot let the question of the over-all level of military expenditures diminish the drive we put in to reach the established goals because they are still very substantial increases above our current levels.","gentlemen, the presentation i want to place before you was originally prepared several weeks ago to help the mobilization officials who were concerned with appraising the material problems, the material implications that would follow the acceptance of a military budget of $50 billion of new funds in fiscal 1953, or a con­siderably higher budget, the $85 billion figure, which was the aggregate of all of the requests that came to secretary lovett from the services.","it is not an attempt to forecast what decisions should be made, but rather an effort to indicate the problems which called for a decision, and to appraise the' effect on the rest of the economy of carrying a military budget at something like a $50 billion level, which was the level they were then working at and looking forward to, or a consider­ably higher level.","on the demand side, we tried to indicate a translation into steel, copper and aluminum of the requirements to carry a $50 billion new fund military program for fiscal year 1953, and the larger amount of such materials to carry a larger military program supported by some­thing like an $85 billion appropriation for fiscal year 1953. 
for the rest of the economy, outside of the department of defense and the atomic energy commission, we tried in general to forecast a level which was pretty close to the level actually established by allot­ments for the first quarter of the calendar year 1952. those allot­ments had already been made.",we have had to cut back in order to make possible the necessary increases in military and industrial uses.,"it now appears, as we are building up experience in the present emergency, there is a some­what lower rate of disappearance of tickets than occurred during 
world war 11' we are not entirely sure that we understand all the reasons for it, but we think in general it is because we are still carrying on a fair level of civilian production which was wholly cut out m world war ii, and the civilian producers, because they have been cut 
back below levels they were operating at before korea, are using 
every lfiket they get.","we faced a deficit for the second quarter, which meant we would have to accommodate to this larger military need and that we would have to cut back on allotments below the first-quarter level in this gray area.","with a $50-billion program there is a problem in the 
second, tlird, and fourth quarters of the calendar year 1952 that 
would tend to disappear in 1953. with a higher program, you get a 
much more serious problem in the quarters ahead of us, and it would go 
right out into the middle of 1953, and you would have a serious 
deficit in 1953. 
once you agree to support military needs, which is our objective, 
you have to meet that by squeezing elsewhere.","obligations and expenditures of military funds

expenditure picture is going to look like?","mr. wilson, will you make some appropriate com­ments for the committee regarding the feasibility of a $50 billion military budget and an $85 billion military budget?",will you also discuss somewhat the impact on the economy of a military budget in the range of $50 billion and a military budget in the range of $85 billion.,"you have asked me to comment on (a) the feasibility and (b) the impact on the economy of a $50 billion military budget 
ald an $85 billion budget.","it is now estimated that only about $17 billion of this amount will be spent in fiscal 1952. unless more than normal lead-time financing is to be provided, it would be necessary to spend at an average annual rate of $46 billion for major procurement and production in fiscal 1953 and fiscal 1954. this, to­gether with other military expenditures, would imply total military spending by the department of defense of more -than $80 billion annually in fiscal 1953 and 1954.

defense budget for 1953 

witnesses 
hon.","i appreciate the opportunity of appearing before this committee in support of the president's budget estimates of $52.1 billion for the department of defense for fiscal year 1953. may i begin by summarizing the increases in military forces and production which have been achieved during the past -18 months with the $48.2 billion appropriated in fiscal year 1951 and the $59.4 billion appro­priated to date for fiscal year 1952. 
at the end of june 1'950, when hostilities began in korea, the military personnel for the department of defense totaled 1,460,000. as of january 1, 1952, this force has been expanded so that we now have nearly 3 million men in service.","while the expansion in military personnel and organized combat units has been very substantial during this period, the expansion of production and production capabilities is of greater proportion and has utilized the major portion of the total funds appropriated by the congress.","expenditures and obligations 
to achieve this expansion of military forces and production, the 
department of defense expended, on its own account $19.2 billion in fiscal year 1951; during the first 6 months of fiscal year 1952, the department has expended $17.4 billion.",it is anticipated that by next june expenditures during fiscal year 1952 for the department of defense will be approximately $40 billion.,these figures are exclusive of expenditures for the military portion of the foreign aid funds.,"background for preparation of military budget 
as background for the military budget for fiscal year 1953, it may serve a useful purpose to outline the basic considerations which were taken into account in the preparation of the three military depart­ments' requirements for this period.","if a military pro­gram is developed which cuts too deeply into the civilian economy bythe removal of excessive amounts of scarce raw materials, largenumbers of productive enterprises will be forced to cut back and per­haps shut down altogether as a result of the inability to obtain the essential critical materials needed to keep going.","procedure used in formulating budget 
the procedure in the formulation of the military requirements budgets was essentially the same as that followed in the supplementals of fiscal year 1951 and the basic budget for fiscal year 1952. that is to say, the three armed services estimated their military and end-item requirements based on the forces recommended by the joint chiefs of staff and approved by the national security council, related to a readiness date by which each service was to be combat-worthy.","whereas in the previous 2 years the impact of the recently started re­
armament program had not noticeably affected industry as a whole, 
it wag apparent, in the case of the fiscal year 1953 military budget, 
that the test of feasibility of the program in the light of the shortages 
of certain essential basic raw materials become of cardinal importance.","in other cases the requests of te military depart­inents would result in total military expenditures which would be excessive in the judgment of other competent agencies of the govern­ment and which, in their opinion, would jeopardize the economy or financial stability of the country to a degree which was unacceptable and unwise.","original budget figures 
the initial budget requests submitted to my office by the three armed services, based on military requirements and early readiness dates, totaled approximately $71 billion, exclusive of the requirements of the military portion of the foreign-aid program.","as a result of the review conducted by the office of the secretary of defense with the three military departments, and as a consequence of the screening process at that stage of budgetary development, the original estimates in their rough form were reduced to a finished budget of approxi­mately $55 billion.",the department of defense recommended the latter figure to the bureau of the budget and to the president as a reasonable fund requirement.,"to reach an acceptable state of readiness by july 1, 1953, in the case of the army and -marine corps and later for the navy and air force would have involved, according to the original estimates of the three military departments, expendi­tures in fiscal year 1953 totaling approximately $73 billion, exclusive of expenditures for military assistance to other countries.","size of military in fiscal year 1953 
the funds being requested herein for fiscal year 1953 will, however, permit, the army to expand toward a goal of 21 full-strength divisions; the navv toward a goal of 408 combat vessels with 16 carrier air groups; the ,marines toward a goal of 3 full divisions and 3 air wings; and the air force to build toward a goal of 143 wings.","to assure that the goals set forth in this budget are achieved, i have directed the chairman of the munitions board and mr. clay bedford, an outstanding production expert who has recently joined my staff, to work with the three military departments to break any existing bottlenecks in military contracting or production techniques that might retard us in reaching our goals.","i believe that with this con­centrated effort the desired production will be achieved: measured in dollars, this means expenditures of over $85 billion during the next 18 months by the department of defense, two-thirds of which will be for hard goods and construction.",i should add that these figures include expenditures for the military portion of the foreign-aid program.,"it is our opinion that these additional amounts are extremely im­portant if industry is to have a reasonable opportunity to comply with the decision to produce needed military equipment and simul­taneously to carry on a reasonable level of production for the civilian economy, because with the additional funds being requested we will be able to nuke firm contracts for military production involinng de­livery of goods during the next 2 or 3 years.","now, we have had the idea that these military people did not know 
anything about the value of dollars; did not know anything about business, and did not care how much anything cost.","apparently, a couple of governments in western europe have fallen because of the emphasis they placed, which was not predominant, on military spending.","there is a certain point beyond which the american people will not 
go on military spending short of an all-out general war.","if we confidently expected war to break out on some given nearby date, we would cut into the civilian economy regardless of the consequences, because our safety and freedom might be at stake.","you cannot cut too dirastically into a civilian 
economy short of an all-out war and maintain it definitely as a democracy, i would assume.","the people at, home are saying, and some people of the press are saying, ""why, in heaven's name, does the congress provide the de­partment of defense with money which they cannot, spend; money 
which they do not spend.""","to give you a specific example: the norden bombsight in world war ii cost in moderate procurement numbers initially about $8,000.","the b-17, which was produced by the same company and which was our standard in world war ii, cost this government about $555,000, so you have a 6-plus multiplier in costs.","some of them are going to say that we are just playing along with this matter of national defense and that the services were more correct when their first estimate indicated $71 billion than they are now at $52 billion; therefore, this budget does not prepare us adequately to meet the critical conditions in the world today.","it looks like we are going to have some degree of stability; therefore, let us cut this military budget down rather 
drastically.""",what all of us have to do is to find out some way of balancing the chance of war against the cost of maintaining an adequate militarystrength over a period of time.,"well, members of the committee when they go to the floor during this session are going to be confronted with this thing: congressman x is going to say, ""i was out with some military people a few days ago and colonel or general or admiral so-and-so told me that you could cut this military budget one-third and get a better-defense program.""","on the other hand, it is the best method of resolving that problem and taking a calculated risk that we have been able to find, and it represents the consensus of the military, the office of defense mobili­
zation, the national security council, the bureau of the budget, and the president in searching for a solution to an insoluble problem.","in addition, these schedules mentioned above will concurrently be submitted 
to the assistant secretary of defense (comptroller) for review and approval from 
a budget and fiscal standpoint and he will effect, with the military departments, 
any adjustments required.",the highest priority is to be given to the re'luirenients of the military departments for current production ileds and the secondary priority to the machine tool requirements for the so-called excess capacity.,"statement by the president at a meeting on the defense production program, april 27, 1951, to officials of the department of defense, office of defense mobilization, defense production ad-ministration, national production authority, and bureau of the budget 
1. for the last several weeks many of you gentlemen have been involved in an intensive effort to develop the military budget for 1952. that budget represents one of the most significant programing jobs that this administration ik going to place before the congress this year.",2. passage of this budget will place tremendous procurement and spending authority in the hands of the department of defense and the three services.,"5. 
specifically, before tbis money becomes available for expenditure we must have accomplished the following two actions: 


(a) 
creation by the department of defense of a system to control the require­ments for and check on utilization of civilian and military personnel.","i understand that, there is agreement among the office of defense mobilization, the defense production administra­tion, the defense department, and the bureau of the budget that the following steps are feasible and should be accomplished before this money becomes avail­able for expenditure: 
(a) establishment of specific, realistic production schedules covering items comprising at least 70 to 75 percent of the dollars for hard-goods items.","the department of defense has to have the machinery to establish for itself 
the priorities in its program.","attitude of military personnel toward 1953 budget

the program were considered.","expressed in dollars, the result is a program calling for $52 billion in new obligational authority for the department of defense and requir­ing less than $60 billion in expenditures in fiscal year 1953, including the military portion of foreign-aid programs.",i think the history of our expenditures in world war ii is the same.,"in other categories, largely for the annual recurring costs of operat­ing and maintaining the military establishment, every effort has been made, within the time available for analysis and review, to keep the request for new obligational authority to a minimum consistent with the degree of readiness which must be maintained.","distribution of new obligational authority

funds requested for military personnel costs in fiscal year 1953 under present legislation are $10,933,000,000, or about 22 percent of the budget.","(in addition to this amount, approximately $1 billion of the $3.5 billion included in the budget under ""proposed legislation"" is intended to cover the cost of pending legislation which, if enacted, would grant military personnel an increase in pay and allowances.)","because a substantial portion of present inventories of aircraft for the air force and naval aviation are of world war ii 
types, the fiscal year 1953 budget calls for approximately 10,500
aircraft in order to continue the modernization of these two forces.","i might, also add that some portion of the higher average costs per vessel are the result of korean operations where they have been operating virtually under war conditions.","the increased stock

m1r.",chairman vinson of the armed forces committee asked what it would cost to maintain a military establishment on the basis of a 3.5-million-man force.,"the $11,000 or $12,000 figure as of this time, would cover the cost of all operating equipment that is used; and, in a sense, it has little relationship to the cost of maintaining an individual in the military service.","he, of course, works with, and we have worked with, the bureau of the budget in the preparation of this figure, so that the final figure really represents the cooperation of the services-the research and development board, the secretary of defense, and the bureau of the budget.",the secretary of defense re­quires us to recommend to him that this obligation of funds be made before the funds are obligated.,"but, as i recall the early part of your statement even in the preliminary budget of the military forces themselves, your people are consulted as to the potentials involved, which would resolve themselves into the amounts that the particular service requests; is 
that correct?",the total amount for salaries that is involved in the office of the secretary of defense in the breakdown of the budget as we are con­sidering it is $15 million.,there is no item in the budget breakdown for the office of the secretary of defense that could possibly include an item similar to the $60 million that seems to be set up.,hence it seemed wiser to include the pro­vision of this approximately $20 million for atomic tests in the emer­gency fund to be released by the secretary of defense at our recom­mendations as the need for those tests developed.,"for example, to develop one jet 
fighter today costs from 5 to 10 times as much as to develop a world 
war ii fighter.","i would say that the over-all increase is one we feel is quite fairlyjustified, and i might note to you that the department of defense itself, meaning the secretary, agreed that in a total-military budget, which was somewhat diminished as against last year, it was logicalthat the research and development part actually be increased in 1953 as against 1952. 
mr. sikes.","the approval of the projects, before the funds can actually be ex­
pended, has to be recommended by the research and development
board to the secretary of defense.","of the department of defense funds being requested for human resources research during the past 3 years, a substantial part of the annual budgets included funds which are devoted directly to the development and construction of training aids and services.",these funds are expended chiefly through the military laboratories which specialize in research on the different aspects of man in relation to his military tasks.,"if you are going to reduce military programs and your 
research and development is related to your anticipated program, 
your research and development funds could be much less; if you are 
going to do your program over a long period of time, you can do it 
in smaller bites for less money.","my concept of a reasonable research and develop­
ment budget over, the years is that while i would say i am afraid it is 
going to go up a little bit, i do not think it should be thought of as any 
fixed percentage of the total military budget.","if, for example, the military budget 
total went away up because of large procurement funds, that is no 
reason why research and development should, percentagewise, go up 
at the same time.","in

the contemplated military program that is thought to be the wisest 
program under the alternative we face.",another expediting measure has been the granting to machine tool producers-of priorities on materials equal to the military program priorities.,"in other words, any increase in the military program as contemplated in the 1953 budget, the increase in supply of steel and aluminum should more than cover any increase there may be in our program.","the department of defense, in cooperation with american indus­try and the civilian control agencies, knows how to accomplish, in our
opinion, this well-conceived and carefully reviewed program for which funds have been requested.","there are a variety of lead-time concepts, but for present purposes 
we should consider lead time as the whole period from the time when funds are made available by congress (the point when the procure­ment process may be started), until actual acceptance of delivery ofthe required end items of military equipment.","taking into account the advance planning that must be done by the military and its contractors, and the administrative and produc­tion-lead times involved in the procurement and fabrication of mili­tary supplies, the budget request represents the minimum amounts that must be placed under contract during the fiscal year 1953 in order to permit projection of firm production schedules which carry on the production program initiated with fiscal year 1952 and prior funds without arbitrary cut-backs in defense-production activitywhich would be costly in terms of industrial readiness as well as money.","expenditures 
to equip and suply the armed services at the level of 3.7 million men, and to provide some strategic war reserves, expenditures for procurement of military equipment and supplies and construction must average about $3.5 billion per month throughout fiscal year 1953, including the military portion of foreign-aid programs, compared to a current rate of about $2 billion per month.","with a strong endorsement of the fiscal 1953 budget request of the department of defense, i conclude my formal statement.","1. participate in the development of national systems of priorities and con­trol, and coordinate the operation of such systems within the department of defense.","and on the basis of the relative military urgencies expressed by the joint chiefs of staff, assign industrial priorities to the various requirements presented

to the requirements of the military departments for current production needs and the secondary priority to the machine tool requirements for the so-called excess capacity.","examinations also will be given on a priority basis to the feasibility of assigning to a single military dpopart­ment responsibility for procurement, distribution, including (leipot storage and issue, and maintenance of common categories of supply.","(b) 
the supply systems developed shall be such that the combat efficiency of the armed services as a whole is the most effective which can be obtained within the limits of available personnel, funds, materiel, and legislative authority, and the procedures and methods of operation for the system of supply practicable for war will govern techniques used in time of peace.","(o)

support of the department of defense budget, you requested that the munitions board staff prepare a statement as to criticisms which have been made recentlywith respect to the munitions board, and our reaction or reply.","i-owever, during the whole postwar period from the conclusion of world war ii to the outbreak of korea, the amount of funds made available by the congress precluded completely the achievement of the great majority of stockpile goals.","t me give you an example: back quite a number of years ago a young officer in the navy, before the last war, said: 
we are having a lot of trouble and spending a lot of money on repair and replacement for salt-water lines running through the ship.",it was my understanding that these figures and the costs and so on were going to be presented by the'office' of the secretary of defense in the composite of what they are doing in the whole office.,"the estimated expenditure for 1952 is $5,91,3 o for 
786 civilians and 114 military.","in any case where we have not the personnel to carry out the job, we go back and would go back to the congress, if need be, and to the secretary of defense, and say: 
""let us cut this one out; we just cannot do it.","may i add, mr. small, that in the figures'i gave are included requirements for the military traffic service, which is part of the office of the secretary of defense, but because it is a related activity it is budgeted under our section in the total office of the 
secretary of defense budget.","ordinarily it is not a revolving fund, because the stockpile is supposed to be inviolate until we run into anf ""all-out"" war.","using the best figures which they can get from every aencv involved-most of these figures do not come from the military, but they come from the civilian side of the river-figures out the probe ­able supply in the event of an all-out war, taking into account what the joint chiefs of staff tell us as to the danger of being cut off from this area, or of what the state department and the joint chiefs of staff and intelligence tell us about the danger of sabotage or infiltra­tion or whatever from some of the areas that are slightly ""pink,"" let us say.","william c. foster, the deputy secretary of defense lyle s. garlock, deputy comptroller for budget

to costs, and so forth?",whatever is going on there now can probably be improved from a civilian standpoint rather than duplicating the thing and spending some of our defense money that we might need to defend the country.,but you expect to have a budget for the department defense and tell us that that is your budget and that you want us to appropriate that money.,"if i did not think i would get some support to improve the organization of the defense department, and if i did not think we could make some more economies, i would advocate the budget as it is, because actually it was worked up with a great deal of time and patience and represents what our military think is necessary, and they are still there.","in other words, you recognize that the military budget made up by the previous administration is not a political instrument, but is rather the best judgment of the people in the pentagon?",i am talking about the military budget.,we reduced the budget last year by $5.5 billion in the military.,"if we make a reduction in the truman military budget of $5.5 billion this year we will be down to about $36 billion, and i was hoping that by increased efficiency and new techniques to safeguard the taxpayer, particularly in the field of procurement, you could bring your budget down without harming our military buildup to below $40 billion.","as i see the picture, you can walk right into the situation now and consider whether or not through renegotiation, reconsideration, readjustment, you can get more for the defense dollar in procurement with funds that were appropriated before your term of office began, but funds which are being spent or which will be spent during your your term of office.","but it does seem to me that if you abolished about 100 committees over there and established one entitled ""committee on the reduction of the unit cost of defense items,"" it would be good business and might save us a billion or so.","mr. sarnoff says, i believe, that we could cut person­nel by 500,000. he does not say whether it is military or civilian.","i am not going to cut the number of divisions, for instance, or the combat teams, or anything like that.","relationship between pace of defense production and

defense budget for 1954

w. 	j. mcneil, assistant secretary of defense (comptrol­ler) 
l. s. garlock, deputy comptroller for budget william h. mautz, director, economic and international 
security estimates division brig.","mr. chairman and members of the committee, this statement is made to summarize the basic aims involved in the fiscal year 1954 budget for the department of defense presented to the congress by president truman on january 9, 1953. 
basis underlying budget planning for 1954 
this budget continued the partial mobilization philosophy expressed by the then secretary of defense, gen. george c. marshall, before the congress in december 1950, and reiterated to this committee last year in connection with consideration of the fiscal year 1953 budget.","this concept of partial or limited mobilization which could be accelerated or slowed down as indicated by the forecast of future events under­laid the military program and the budget planning for fiscal year 1954. 
during the past 2 years it has been the policy of the department of defense to acquire sufficient new equipment and supplies to modernize the forces and accumulate a limited amount of stock and then to the maximum feasible extent depend on the capabilities of the industrial potential that has been established to provide such additional equip­ment and supplies as might be required in case of large-scale hostilities.","increase in military strength 
in considering the budget request for fiscal year 1954, it may be helpful to examine the increase in military strength that has been achieved during the past 30 months with the $156.6j billion that has been appropriated to date since the communist attack on korea.","the fiscal year 1954 budget provided for an army strength of 1,538,000 on june 30, 1954, maintaining the same organi­zational strength of 20 divisions and 18 regimental combat teams.","to insure that the 1954 budget requests of the military depart­ments were prepared on a consistent basis, a series of detailed plan, 
31393-53-pt.","1----4 
ning assumptions or ""guide lines"" were sent to the military depart­ments in the spring of 1952. a basic principle underlying the 1954 budget request was stated as follows: 
in the formulation of fiscal year 1954 department of defense program plansand budget estimates the primary objective shall be to maintain approved peace­time military forces in a high state of readiness and to continue to improve the mobilization potential of the armed forces in order to assure an adequate militarycapability necessary to support united states foreign policy for an indefinite period into the future.","the severe strains which may be imposed upon this economy by a high state of military readiness for a long periodof time must be fully recognized and more than ever before there must be a full awareness in the preparation of budget estimates for fiscal year 1954 of the necessity for elimination of nonessential activities, the prevention of unnecessaryexpenditure of material, manpower, or money and a complete application of the basic principles of cost consciousness.","therefore, even though no separate package is identified as repre­senting korean costs, it does not mean we have not provided resources to carry on such operations in korea.","in food you will find it a little higher, because combat rations cost a little more than normal rations for a post.","similarly, in determining the funds required to continue production of various military items at the minimum industrial sustaining rates, credit was taken for ""military-assistance"" funds presently or prospectively available to the department of defense.","in preparing our 1954 budget estimates, how­ever, the department of defense was kiirectedtto'budget on a gross basis, and provision has been made for the deposit 'of the 'dollar equivalent of foreign credits directly to the treasury.","this has the effect of increasing the obligational authority required by the depart­ment of defense in 1954 by over one-half billion dollars, and will increase reported defense expenditures by the same amount.","if this new procedure were eliminated, the defense budget could be reduced by over one-half billion dollars, without change m program or in the net expenditures from the treasury.",the budget officers of the military departments will be prepared to identify these amounts during the course of your hearings.,"it therefore would require greater obligational authority, and will show greater expenditures for the department of defense.","to provide such control-if this were taken out i 
think you people have every right to ask for a german-mark budget 
for the united states, and a japanese-yen budget, and indicate your 
approval or disapproval of the use of such defense support.","the budget now before you reflected the best judgment, as of the end of december 1952, after consideration by the president, of the amounts necessary in fiscal year 1954 to carry forward the planned military programs on the time schedules which will be discussed during the course of your hearings.","a expenditures and unexpended balances, 1950 
r 
as of june 30, 1950, the department of defense had an unexpended balance of $9.8 billion.","of this total, $5.6 billion was for the procure­ment of major items of equipment, $0.5 billion represented carryover of military public-works funds and the remaining $3.7 billion covered accrued military and civilian payrolls, food, clothing, bills for utilities and services, and other day-to-day operating expenses of the military establishment, as well as outstanding obligations for spare parts, procurement, research, and development.","of this, $22.8 billion, or 47 percent, was pro­vided for major procurement, with $2.4 billion for military public works, and $23 billion for military and civilian pay, food, clothing, research and development and other day-to-day operating costs.","this left the department of defense with a total unexpended balance of $38.1 billion at the end of fiscal year 1951, equivalent to approximately twice the total expenditures achieved during the previous year.","of this, $29.2 billion, or 48 percent, was provided for major procurement, with $4 billion provided for military public works and $27.2 billion for other operating costs.",this brought the total avail­able for expenditure since the attack on korea to $118.4 billion.,"of this $4.7 billion unexpended balance for 
military public works and $42.4 billion unexpended balance for major procurement, and $12 billion unexpended balance for other operating costs $7.1 billion was unobligated as of that date, with over $3 billion of it in military public works.","the obligational authority provided for operating costs in 1953 is actually $2.3 billion less than provided in 1952, despite increased military personnel costs.",department of defense expenditures during the current fiscal year are expected to total $44.1 billion.,"at the 1953 rate of expenditure, this represents approximately 2% years funding, which is the same relationship that existed on june 30, 1950, at the outset of the current defense buildup.","the unexpended balance of military public-works funds at the end 
of the current fiscal year is expected to remain $4.8 billion, which at 
the 1953 rate of expenditure, is equivalent to 2 years financing.","thus, the total unexpended balance 
estimated to be available to the department of defense at the begin­
ning of fiscal year 1954 amounts to $62.3 billion-$45.6 billion for 
major procurement, $4.8 billion for military public works, and $11.9 
billion for other operating costs.","discrepancy in budget and defense figures 
mr. scrivner.",which is right-the figure in president truman's budget or the figure the defense department is presenting?,"so that if the defense de­partment figures are correct, the deficit will be closer to $12.5 billion than it would be to president truman's estimate of $10 billion.","so long as 3,600,000 people are in the military establishment, you may by better management, and so forth, by squeezing down a little bit, get some economies, but essentially the expenditures for pay and allowances and food, and so forth-clothing -stay rather constant.",so that the closer we can come to operating on a cash basis the less our defense effort is going to cost us.,"the budget as presented was to provide funds to maintain the 
forces, previously outlined, that is, the 3,600,000-plus, in a high rate 
of readiness; continue the build-up toward the military strengths 
recommended last year; procure the material and equipment neces­
sary to equip and modernize the active forces; provide certain mobiliza­
tion reserves and maintain an expansible mobilization base for an 
indefinite period of time.","in determining the amount of additional obligational authority re­quired for 1954, on the basis of the information available at the begin­ning of december 1952, it was stated that account was taken not only of the unexpended balance of $45.6 billion expected to be outstanding at the beginning of fiscal year 1954, but substantial deductions were made to reflect the anticipated availability of military assistance funds to meet part of the costs of maintaining some of our production lines at minimum sustaining rates.","it was then determined that the unex­pended balances that would be available as of june 30, 1953, when applied to the new tank production schedules, would cover all but $82 million of the funds required in fiscal year 1954. consideration was then given to the fact that the fiscal year 1954 military assistance program was expected to call for a number of medium tanks.","in consideration of the anticipated availability of military assistance funds, it was decided to omit completely from the regular army budget the $82 million required in 1954 for maintenance of medium tank production.","military public works 
the 1954 budget requests $700 million for military public works for the air force.","in analyzing the service needs for additional military public works funds in 1954, it was found, in the c'ise of the army and navy, that the increment of additional funding relating to existing authorizations was so closely interrelated with the remainder of their programs which were being proposed for authorization that it would be more meaning­ful to request additional funds after authorization had been obtained for the remainder of their programs.",additional funds of an undl'rniined amount may be requested in a supplemental budget request to finance such essential military construction projects as are subsequently submitted to and authorized by the congress.,"other operating costs 
as previously stated, $26.4 billion of the $41.3 billion requested in the 1954 budget is to cover other operating costs; i. e., those costs other than major procurement and military public works.","by category, these costs can be broken down as follows: 
military personnel costs 
incidentally, i think there are some tables which may give this in 
tabular form.","funds requested for military personnel costs in fiscal year 1954 are 
$11,721,000,000, or 28 percent of the budget, of which $9,304,000,000 
is required for military pay and allowances, and the remaining 
$2,417,000,000 covers the cost of food, individual clothing, trans­
portation, and other military personnel costs.","this is about $200 
million less than the amount required for this purpose in fiscal year 
1953, if account is taken of the costs of the military pay increase, 
mustering-out pay, and combat duty pay voted at the end of the last 
session of congress.","despite this decrease in funds, average strength was 
expected to increase from approximately 3,559,000 man-years in 
fiscal year 1953 to 3,655,000 man-years in fiscal year 1954. 
the funds requested in the 1954 budget for military pay and allowances are based upon existing pay rates applied to the planned strengths just outlined.","operation and maintenance 
ten billion, three-hundred and sixty-eight million dollars is requested in the 1954 budget, or 25 percent of the total, for operation and maintenance of weapons, equipment, and installations of the depart­ment of defense.","this takes into account the improvement in military plant and facilities, including deferred maintenance, that has been effected with funds provided in previous years.","research and development 
the fiscal year 1954 budget estimates for research and development total $1,778,000,000, of which $203 million consists of indirect re­search and development costs, compared with $1,664,000,000 in 1953 and $1,499,000,000 in 1952. in developing the estimates re­liance was placed on the research and development board to elimi­nate undesirable duplication, terminate unpromising effort, assure that the most promising projects would receive support, and to keep the military research and development program at a reasonable level.","in addition, some part of the funds may be used to acquire and ""mothball"" existing privately owned facilities, now en­gaged in production of potential ""bottleneck components"" of key military items, but which may be converted from military production and lost as part of the mobilization base because of the inability to keep the facilities producing military items once immediate require­ments have been met.","establishment-wide activities 
the remainder of the budget request consists of $972 million for establishment-wide activities; $507 million of this amount covers the costs of operating certain joint activities in which all three military departments have an interest as well as certain joint schools and boards.","retired pay accounts for the other major segment of this category, amounting to $375 million compared with $355 million in 1953. because of uncertainty as to the end of hostilities in korea, $75 million has been requested for the costs of emergency civilian relief in korea 
in 1954. the department of defense must plan to continue essential relief activities in korea until the military situation permits the 
united nations korean reconstruction agency to assume this func­tion as provided by section 303 of the mutual security act of 1951 (public law 165, '2d cong.","this is the same as the amount appropriated for the office of the secretary of defense in 1953. 
overall estimated expenditures 
the program of the department of defense, if carried out as con-i emplated when the budget was submitted, would involve the expen­diture of nearly $48 billion in fiscal year 1954. of this, $19.8 billion would be spent for major procurement; $2.6 billion for military public works; and $25.6 billion for other operating costs.","procurement expenditures were planned to reach their peak in fiscal year 1954, reflecting deliveries and payments stemming from the peak in obligational authority granted in fiscal year 1952. the increase in military construction expenditures over 1953 reflects the progress of the construction program started after the attack on korea.",there is a difference of $2.5 billion between department of defense estimate of expenditures in fiscal year 1954 and those shown in the january 1953 budget document.,"this difference in the estimates resulted from a difference of opinion as to the rate at which production would progress during fiscal year 1954. production schedules were examined and checks were made with defense contractors, and based on this examination, the department of defense estimates of 1954 expenditures were developed.","the $12.5 billion carryover for other operating costs represents a normal year-end balance, and is broken down into the following categories: 
billion 
military personnel costs $-----------------------------------------
2.","6 other activities -------------------------------------------------3.0 
the $2.9 billion unexpended balance for military public works represents about 1 year's forward financing, and would be increased by the amount of any additional funds provided for in any new authori­zat ion.","in summary, therefore, the fiscal c 1954 budget, inear as prepared 
december 1952, reflected the partial mobilization philosophy upon 
which the military program has been based since the communist 
attack on korea.","this budget was to contain the final major incre­
ment of funds required to finance the military force buildup authorized 
in the fall of 1951, with future years' budgets devoted largely to the 
costs of operating and maintaining the forces at approved levels, 
including the costs of replacement of obsolescent equipment and 
maintenance of an adequate production mobilization base.","for the overall department of defense, here is a history of expen­ditures running from the summer of 1950. at that time expenditures were running about $225 million to $235 million per week.","(the tables are as follows:)

i data for fiscal year 1953 and fiscal year 1954 were estimated based on information available in december 1952. estimated lapses and transfers were based on the assumption that permission would be granted to the department of defense to meet part of the fiscal year 1953 costs of the military pay raise, mustering-out pay and combat duty pay by the use of the unobligated balances of fiscal year 1952 and prior year funds which would otherwise lapse and revert to the treasury.","the budget as presented by president tru­man calls for appropriations of approximately $41.3 billion, and, as has been pointed out, contemplates the expenditure, according to the bureau of the budget, of $45.5 billion, and according to the depart­ment of defense, of $48 billion.","i note as a matter of history that last year the estimated expendi­ture for the fiscal year 1953 at this stage of the game by the depart­ment of defense was $51 billion, and by the bureau of the budget was $41.5 billion, and apparently it actually will turn out to be about $44.1 billion, about $2 billion below the ceiling suggested by the house.","korean combat costs in estimate 
i understand that there is nothing in the budget before us for korea except for ammunition on a 6-month basis.","the record will show that korea supplementals have had to include only limited sums to balance out shortages, which indicates two things: first, an effort being made during the year properly to utilize funds made available; and second, that no matter how carefully you do it, there do get into the estimates of requirements of end items, quantities somewhat above the bare minimum you later find you could have gotten along with.",do you mean there is some leeway in the 1954 budget for expenses in korea over and above ammunition?,"what would be the cost of the military machine, 
you mean?","virtually all the first-year expenditures represent the costs of military and civilian pay, transportation, utilities, and other day-to-day operating costs of the military establishment.","approximately two-thirds of the unexpended balance remaining at the end of the first year is spent during the following 2 years, reflecting payment for the remainder of the day-to-day operat­ing costs not paid during the first year as well as expenditure to fever military public works put in place and major procurement deliveries.","the remaining funds cover payments due for outstanding contracts for long lead-time major procure­ment items and military public works, and are largely spent during the following 2 years (fourth and fifth years of expenditure availability), with some re-idual amounts for aircraft and ships not spent until the sixth year of availability.","military assistance funds 
mr. wigglesworth.",that is the military assistance funds picture.,the funds would come from department of defense funds and from military assistance.,"it was intended to show that instead of asking for additional funds in the department of defense to keep the tank line running, the funds military assistance had earmarked for tanks were taken into consideration to keep that line running.","87

mr. wigglesworth.","expenditures of the army, the navy, the air force, 
and the office of the secretary of defense.","i would like to have that broken down in a 
table as to major procurement, soft goods procurement, military public works and other expenditure as of now and as of the end of the fiscal year, as of december 31, 1953, and as of june 30, 1954, under the expenditure per week estimated on those dates.","well, generally the clause will provide for cancella­tion at the convenience of the government, but the contractor would be entitled to settlement very much on the same terms as the contracts were settled at the conclusion of world war ii, which was for the costs incurred and a reasonable profit on the work he had done up to that period.",it is essentially the same type of analysis and review that the several secretaries of defense have attempted to develop to analyze require­ments in the course of budget reviews.,"if the work has to be done for one reason or another, the assignment of certain military personnel for the job will cost more than civilians.","so i think it is one of the things that we have to pursue intensively, and i do not think there is an easy answer, because there are military personnel in hundreds of places where you might put in a civilian that costs less per annum.","2.

turning to page a-5 of the budget as submitted, under the head­ing ""budget expenditures,"" the first item ""military services,"" the figure of $46,296 million is used.","the figure of $46,296 million, which is the estimated expenditures as proposed in the truman budget for the military, if added to the $2.5 billion, will take you up over $48 billion which, in the final result takes you up over $275 billion as the estimated debt of the federal government as of june 30, 1954, which is, of course, beyond the debt limitation of $275 billion.",my calculations-using the truman budget expenditure figure and adding the $2.5 billion to the truman military budget-would make it seem that there is an error or a miscalculation on the part of the bureau of the budget or on the part of the department of defense of about 5.4 percent.,"and if we take the truman budget estimated deficit for the fiscal year 1954 which, according to page a-5, the table on that page, is $9.922 billion, and add an additional $2.5 billion, which would result if the department of defense figures are more accurate than those of the truman budget, we find that there is a 
25.2 percent error in the calculations of the deficit for the fiscal year 1954. in other words, there is a 25 percent in the truman estimate of the deficit for the fiscal year 1954. 
has there ever been this much variance between the estimate of the bureau of the budget as to your expenditures and the estimate of the department of defense?","now, some twenty billion-odd dollars worth of expenditures in the department of defense are tied very closely to actual strength and the number of aircraft and ships that are operating, so in the area the only place where you can get any substantial expenditure reductions is, for example, in flying aircraft 27 hours instead of 28 hours per month for the squadron; or steaming a little less, or finding some way in which you can carry out the procurement function with 5 percent fewer people and still get the job done.","did the bureau of the budget have precisely the same 
figures that the department of defense had at the time they made 
their decision on $46-billion-plus and the department of defense took 
the figure of $48-billion-plus for the fiscal year 1954?","was there an agreement prior to the printing of this budget, between the department of defense and the bureau of the budget on the $46-billion-plus figure?","was there ever any objection stated by the department 
of defense officially to the bureau of the budget?","at the time the budget was actually put together by 
the bureau of the budget they were fully informed as to the existence of or the possibility of a $900 million weekly expenditure by the department of defense during the fiscal year 1954?",i have noticed recently in the press that the british budget for military expenditure contemplates a change in emphasis from actual production of standardized items to a greater emphasis on research and development.,"comparative costs of military and civilian personnel 
alr.","what is the gross cost of 1 man-year in military per­sonnel, excepting the korean combat?",".addling the costs of food, clothing, transport ation, and welfare and morale nativities would bring the total direct military personnel costs to an average of about $3,200 per man.","when i made the remark this morning that civilians would be cheaper, i had in mind the indi­rect costs that must be considered in the case of military personnel.","not only must we consider the costs of providing food, clothing, hous­ing, and medical care to the military personnel, but there is also a loss of time involved when military personnel take certain time off for medical examinations, for drawing clothing, for doing guard duty,keeping up a certain amount of military proficiency of one kind or another; whereas the civilian employee will go to the dentist on his own time, get his hair cut on his own time, buy his groceries on his own time.","on that basis, the average cost of a military man would run about $5,500 per year.","for clerical work, it is definitely more expensive to have the military on 
the job instead of the civilian on the basis of total costs involved, even though the civilian rate of direct pay is higher than the military.",will the expiration of the defense production act have any measurable bearing on costs?,"if the truce should come, or if there should be a truce and the united nations korean reconstruction agency should take over, under the law any residual funds would be turned over to the new agency and they would carry out the program and the department of defense would not.","we are attempting to tie together indirect support costs with primary programs in presenting it for intelligent discussion and consideration, first by the secretary of defense and then by you people.","1--9 
turnaround time from tihe west coast to korea andl back has been cut s days in the last 2 years.","it is difficult to provide any accurate figures because 
of the lack of property accounting in the army and air force and the difficulty of estimating current replacement value of world war ii equipment and the value of real property, much of which was acquired at little or no cost.","the number of men in drill pay status in civilian component programs increased from virtually more at the end of the war to over 830,000 as of june 30, 1950. 
these 3 programs, covering military personnel costs of the active forces and their operation and maintenance, and the pay and maintenance costs of the reserve forces, utilized over $34,503,030,03o and constituted 71 percent of the total authority provided in the 4 years sin ethe end of world war ii.",i think this information was compiled by the budget office of the department of defense.,"i may be going off the deep end, but let me say this to you: in my amateurish way it seems perfectly apparent that we have just entered in the last few years, since korea, in a big way into this vast field of electronics, and then for people to tell me that you cannot lower unit costs and lower them drastically just does not make sense.","discrepancy in estimates of military spending 
mr. mahon.",i want to talk a bit about the discrepancy between the president's estimate of military spending in the fiscal year 1954 and your estimate of spending.,"beginning with the fiscal year which would include world war ii and on up to date, has it been true that the department of defense has made an estimate of spending and the president has made an estimate of spending and have they been identical for those years,and if not, what have the variations been?",expenditure estimates during world war ii did not.,that affected the estimates of both the bureau of the budget and the department of defense.,"felt that the figures were pretty good-i predict that congress will mike reductions and that the estimates made by the bureau of the budget, or rather by the president, are likely to be more accurate than department of defense estimates, provided, of course, that.","it is one of those things that you cannot be absolutely sure about and, while i would not say that there was or was not some juggling here, certainly when the country is surcharged with the feeling for economy and the feeling that we must have a reduction, almost anyone would predict, and certainly should predict if publicly expressed views were to be taken seriously, that there would be a reduction in military spending, in which it had been stated the largest reductions could be made.","the probabilities are that the white house prediction as to military 
spending would be more accurate than the department of defense 
prediction.","the estimated lapses and transfers at that time were calculated on the assumption that part of the cost of the military pay raise, mustering-out pay, and combat-duty pay would be met by the use of the unobligated balances of fiscal year 1952 and prior-year funds that would otherwise lapse and revert to the treasury.",this last is what we call the emergency fund of the secretary of defense for research and development.,"(b) 
the chairman of the board shall make recommendations to the secretary of defense with respect to the operating and capital budgets (including any emergency funds) and the plans for the obligation of funds for research and devel­opment activities of all departments and agencies of the department of defepse.","in order to provide for desirable shifts in emphasis and the elimination of unneces­sary expenditure, the chairman of the board shall recommend to the secretary of defense the initiation or elimination of projects or programs, or changes in expenditures on them.","and this is the key change­

changes in expenditures on them.","it normally covers those things, but actually it is a very difficult thing to decide justwhere procurement funds come in on a program that is developing over toward the point where the final article is ready to be produced.i think that i should say in all fairness that there are procurement 
funds undoubtedly involved in the later stages of development where one is, for example, making a lot of missiles which are going to be used primarily for military evaluation rather than for service use.","in other words, if we were to include pro­curement costs and the pay for military personnel assigned to projects,the figure would be much larger?","i wish, when you revise your remarks, you would include your best estimate of the total annual cost for all re­search and development for defense purposes.","i would estimate that the cost to the goverrment of research and development for defense purposes, based upon the fiscal year 1954 budget estimates of the agencies involved, is a little over $2 billion.",i think that is included in the secretary of defense's budget.,it indicated that their 1954 budget for defense would he 40 percent greater in its emphasis on research and development over the previous fiscal year.,"(the matter referred to is as follows:)

some interesting and informative comments as to what research and 
development has cost us in dollars by reason of the fact that we have 
had to transform all of our military programs, more or less?","there has sprung up a feeling in this country, and to some degree in the congress, that we are wasting a lot of money in the field of research and development and that we could get just as much national defense by spending, say $1 billion less per year on research and development than we are spending.","where is it carried in the budget, in the office of the secretary of defense or in the respective branches?",for our central organ­ization it is carried in the budget of the department of defense.,"4.

hence, i firmly believe that your organization shouldfollow through and see that in the original procurement contract your standard­
ized specifications should include enough 
huts taken from the requirements ofthe three branches of the military to permit the successful bidder to bid upon
the basis of amortizing his tool-up cost.","some of the indirect saving resulting from the catalog program, such as decrease in deadlined combat equipment and decrease in administrative costs of handling supplies may not lend themselves to any kind of determination.","when we have established the catalog covering bolts and nuts, we will say, ""gentlemen, design anything that you feel is necessary for the military needs, but utilize these standard bolts, nuts, and so forth, and not the special ones that cost us so much money and are so difficult to procure.""","(c) 
statistical sampling plans are being utilized more extensively by each of the military departments with a resulting savings in manpower and funds.","i am sure, if you have gone through some of the plants that you have enumerated, you must have seen some place, somewhere a great many of these inspection jobs that did not seem to add much to the defense effort, despite the cost.","the record of breakage was practically nil and yet somebody, somewhere, got the idea that the specifications for packing that item as far as the military were concerned had to be of such a kind that it would run the cost up between 7 and 15 times as much as the cost of the item.","may i say that my industry advisory commit­tee, which i spoke of in my testimony, and which is composed of representatives, top representatives in industry in the packaging field, estimate that we can save in the neighborhood of one-third of the money that we are spending for packaging our military supplies.","they think they can fight well, and they win wars, and the people applaud our heroes when they come back from the military expeditions, but still they do not believe we are getting our dollars' worth in defense spending.","(the information requested is as follows:)

that the korean war was a serious load on the defense depart­ment, part of which had not been reflected in the proposed budget.","(g) 
that the rate of expenditures of the entire defense department was averaging approximately $900 million per week, including approximately $60 million per week for the military assistance program.","unexpended balances 
i also found that there were $85.7 billion available for spending as of december 31, 1952, and that a new request was pending for $41.3 billion for the fiscal year beginning this july 1. at the end of the current fiscal year, it is expected that the department of defense will have an unexpended balance of close to $63 billion, with approxi­mately $17 billion available to the army, $17 billion to the navy, $28.5 billion to the air force, and $240 million for the interdepart­mental activities.","this report indicated that the budget program pre­sented t tthe congress in january 1953 not only envisaged a deficit of s9.9 billion in fiscal year 1954 but would also have involved a budget deficit of $15 billion in fiscal year 1955 and further substantial deficits during the next 2 years, with the probability of a balanced federal budget deferred until fiscal year 1958. with this background, it was decided that one of the first and most important tasks of the new administration was an immediate review of the 1954 budget submitted by the previous administration and determination of the steps that could be taken in proceeding toward accomplishment of a balanced budget as soon as practicable, while providing for a con­tinuing increase in effective military strength over what exists today.","examination of defense programs and expenditures 
secretary wilson.","during the month of december 1952 the de­partment of defense had spent slightly over $4 billion, not including military assistance, and was anticipating expenditures at this rate or higher for at least another 18 months.","therefore, it was necessary to reduce the monthly rate of cash expenditure, and to do this it was necessary to examine all defense programs and expenditures to deter­mine what activities could be curtailed or eliminated with little or no effect upon our national security, and what other adjustments should be made to reduce the need for new funds.","as a first step in this process, and in cooperation with the director of the bureau of the budget, we instituted a detailed review of the previous appropriations and current budget requests and each of the secretaries of the military departments was requested to scrutinize carefully the plans and programs of his department.","similarly, the use of funds for all new or barely started construction projects was temporarily halted, pending verification of the real need for each project by the secretaries of the military departments.","during the months of february, march and april, tle department of defense participated in a study by the national security council of the possibility of achieving a balanced cash budget during fiscal year 1954 and a balanced administrative budget during fiscal year 1955. it was concluded that, a complete budget balance could not be attained during these 2 years, without seriousl\-reducing the rate of buildup of our defense capabilities.","however, it was found that by a careful review and balancing of our military effort, important progress could be made in reducing deficits and bringing expenditures and revenue into reasonable balance within the next 2 or 3 years.","our intensive study of the requirements of the department of defense, taking into account appropriations that had already been made, led us to the conclusion that significant reductions could be made in the fiscal year 1954 defense budget by institution of more realistic requirements, better planning and more efficient utilization of manpower and other resources.","by careful balancing of equipment, facilities and manpower, improved military strength could be achieved on a common front without spending quite so much money.",our review also made it perfectly clear that the military forces and stocks of mobilization reserves which previously had been held out as a goal could not be attained within the time contemplated and within the concept of a reasonable balance between federal expenditures and revenues.,"while it is very difficult to control the rate of expenditures when so much money has been appropriated and obligated, after a review of the matter with the national security council the department of defense hopes to keep expenditures for the fiscal year 1954 down to $43.2 billion and hopes to reduce expenditures for fiscal year 1955 to approximately $40 billion in the event the korean war is over.","while the anticipated expenditure for fiscal year 1954 will be ap­proximately the same as the estimated expenditures for the current fiscal year, it is planned to increase the amounts spent for procure­ment of major items of military equipment and other hard goods procurement, and decrease expenditures for personnel, overhead and procurement of soft goods and supplies.","force plans 
as a result of our review, we have developed a revised program which can be financed nwithin the resources available to the depart­ment of defense and at the same time make an important contribu­tion toward bringing government expenditures and revenues into reasonable balance.","in order to do our part in bringing the federal expenditures into reasonable balance with prospective revenue, it, is necessary to take actions now to reduce expenditures other than those previously out­lined with respect to reductions in military and civilian personnel and elimination of some construction projects.","while i have been discussing the defense budget which is before you, the military-assist'ice budget is essentially a part of our security program.","statement of president 
the basic philosophy we are following was recently outlined by the 
president in a statement concerning the budget and defense.","items not in original submission 
as i mentioned earlier, the budget presented in january 1953 called for $41.3 billion, but did not provide for equipping additional rok divisions, nor did it provide for combat consumption in korea through all of fiscal year 1954. the addition of these requirements would have brought the original request to something in excess of $43 billion.","the budget justifications submitted by the military departments will provide a detailed breakdown of the estimated expenditures for fiscal year 1954. under our proposed program, army expenditures would amount to $16.5 billion, navy expenditures to $11 billion, and air force expenditures to $15.1 billion with $0.6 billion for retired pay, contingencies, emergency fund, reserve tools and facilities, 
osd salaries and expenses, and other interdepartmental activities.","that does not mean that we will ignore local or individual situations, but we must consider them in lhe light of our program of making intelligent savings and of achieving the maximum military strength possible from the tax money available.","it is important to spend the money where it will create the greatest security for the country, and a part of it is the mobilization base, or the readiness and ability to produce materiel as needed, to bring men into service rapidly, who are already trained; and where plans can be made so that those men will not have to be kept in military service year after year.","the objective of the defense department, in my concept of it, is to secure the maximum defense position for the country with the least expenditure of money; that is, to get the most security for the dollar.","i may point out that the $16,500,000,000 that we propose for the army is $1,100,000,000 more than the original budget document, and that is on account of the korean war and ammunition.","on page 2 of your statement you refer to the fact that at the end of the current fiscal year it is expected that the department of defense will have an unexpended balance of close to $63 billion, which, if added to the $41,300 million in the so-called truman budget, would have made approximately $104 billion available for expenditure in the fiscal year 1954. that figure of $104 billion now comes down to about $99 billion-

no particular detail to back it up, mostly taking it out of the army on the assumption that the korean war was apparently over.",your own defense department figures show that anticipated expenditures in the fiscal year 1954 would be $48 billion?,"that was the interpretation made, and i want to ask whether or not, after having been on the job for quite some while longer now and having had an opportunity to look into not all, but a great many of these phases of defense spending, you can now see where there can be some savings made, not only reductions in appro­priations, but actual savings of the taxpayers' dollars.","mr. secretary, the reorganization plan, which has been submitted by the department of defense, and this budget are closely related?","this reads: 
while the anticipated expenditure for fiscal year 1954 will be approximatelythe same as the estimated expenditures for the current fiscal year, it is planned to increase the amounts spent for procurement of major items of military equip­ment and other hard-goods procurement, and decrease expenditures for personnel,overhead, and procurement of soft goods and supplies.","you have got to remember that the credit in the bank, which is the money previously appropriated, in itself produced no defense at all, until you started to spend it.","you can argue what the korean war cost, but you get right back to the argument, are you going to keep the same number of divisions and the same number of wings?","on that basis, the korean war does not cost as much as if you drew a circle around korea and said, ""what are you sending over there?'","korean war costs included in estimates 
mr. iiller.","relationship of revised budget and proposed reorganization plan 
now, i believe mr. ford touched on this next point a little bit: the 
basis of the revised defense budget and what relationship there is 
between that revision and the approval of the proposed reorganization 
of the defense department.","will a modification or a rejection of that reorganiza­
tion of the defense department impair to any substantial degree the 
revision that you have made in your defense budget?","all right: who actually wrote down this figure, compiled it, and agreed that that was the defense budget for the three services-you, mr. kyes, mr. mcneil, and the three civilian secretaries?","and said, now, here is where it is; and as far as 
we are concerned in the defense department we finally came up and said, ""we cannot cut the budget enough to balance the nation's budget, because we have all these commitments that we inherited.","i presume you would admit that you would like to have more money for the defense budget, if the economy, in your opinion, and in the judgment of the joint chiefs and in the judgment of the security council, were able to bear it?",this is not the budget of the military; it is the budget of the civilians?,you have not given the military people as much money as they think they ought to have in this budget?,"who made the decision, whose idea was it that we make a defense cut of $5 billion in the air force?",they made an initial analysis and said if we are to balance the budget-i am talking about the federal budget-here is what the defense department would have to cut expenditures down to.,"the bureau of the budget, except for the assignment, for the purposes of this last study, of their military estimates group for the department of defense had nothing to do with the estimates as submitted to the director of the bureau of the budget.","statement submitted by the department of defense with respect, to 
production of aircraft for department of the air force july 1, 1953 to 
december 31, 1955 
air force combat aircraft scheduled for delivery in the period july 1, 1953, to december 31, 1955, are increased by 75 in the budget submitted in may as com­pared with the budget submitted on january 9, 1953. this is almost enough aircraft to equip a fighter wing.","provision for adequate number of fighting combat planes 
the first question is: will this present budget presentation preclude 
the supply of necessary fighting planes, as that supply demand has 
been indicated?","as you have testified here in budget conferences 
with the military personnel that direct the military strategy of our 
country, you have stated that so far-
secretary wilson.","consequently, my question was directed to whether the policy of the military has changed or whether it has not changed, and in either instance, will your present budget supply the necessary combat planes that the military think are necessary under their projected defense of this nation?","we have already cut it all we think we ought to, but we have not cut it to the extent to where the money available will limit our defense activities in these critical times right now, and we will have time enough to reappraise our requirements and tell you 6 or 8 months from now, when this thing comes up, what we then think we need in the way of new money.","mr. secretary, i realize that any hope for a balanced 
budget now, or in the foreseeable future, will have to rest on the 
inclusion of cuts in the defense budget.","any 
cuts that are proposed in military spending are going to cause some 
apprehension somewhere.","i confess some of the apprehension that 
has been expressed by my colleagues here about the places where 
you propose to make these cuts, but i do feel that you are on the 
right track in trying to find the places where cuts can be made in the 
military expenditures, otherwise we will never approach a balanced 
budget under present world conditions.","research, public works-it covers the whole field, including procurement, and some is in military pay costs, subsistence and things of that nature, because of the lower number of military personnel.","inclusion of korean war costs 
mr. sikes.","i certainly approve of your plan of adding the cost of 
the korean war to this budget rather than bringing it to us in a 
supplemental estimate.",can you tell us how much of this budget is for the war in korea?,"if i have understood the secretary and you correctly, your position is (1) that the reduction of funds does not affect the number of combat planes to be delivered in the fiscal year 1954 or in the fiscal year 1955 and 
(2) that reduction in lead time makes it possible to consider subse­quently the planes to be delivered in the fiscal year 1956 and the fiscal year 1957. 
changes in requirements 
mr. kyes.","as far as combat planes are concerned, the reduction in funds does not affect the number of planes to be delivered in 1954 and 1955?","i understand the testi­mony to be that the proposed reduction in funds will not affect the 
manufacture and delivery of combat planes, to be delivered in 1954 and 1955. mr. kyes.","the revised budget request for the department of defense for fiscal year 1954 totals $36,039,320,000 for new obligational authority; $13,671 million for the army, $9,650,695,000 for the navy, $11,688 million for the air force, and $1,029,625,000 for interdepart­mental activities.","these amounts together with the unexpended balance of previous appropriations, aggregating close to $63 billion as of june 30, 1953, would constitute the financing plan for the department of defense for fiscal year 1954. the distribution of the new oblign tional authority and carryover funds by military department is as follows:

i. military personnel costs--------------- --...  ---.","the revised request of the department of defense can be summa­rized by major categories as follows, using the same category break­down that we have in the past: 
military personnel costs 
the revised estimate of funds required for military personnel costs-pay and allowances, individual clothing, food, transportation, 
etc.-in fiscal year 1954 is $11,288 million.","this is $433 million less than the amount requested in january 1953 and is approximately $600 million less than the amount available during fiscal year 1953, 
after effecting the transfer of funds (luring the current year as directed in connection with ihe supplemental request of the military depart­ments to meet the costs of the military pay increase, mustering-out pay, and combat duty pay voted at the end of the last session of the congress.","this is $387 million less than the amount requested for fiscal year 1954 in january 1953. however, the current estimate includes funds to cover in advance the estimated costs of continuation of combat operations in korea throughout fiscal year 1954. these additional operation and maintenance costs are estimated at some­what in excess of $1 billion, with the bulk of this amount included in the appropriation request for the army.","major procurement and production 
the revised estimate of funds required in fiscal year 1954 for pro­curement and production of major items of military equipment is $10,419 million, with $4,517 million for aircraft, $802 million for ships, and $5,100 million for ammunition, weapons, guided missiles, bombs, electronics, and other major items of military equipment.","the increase in ""other procurement"" funds is 'largely
centered in ammunition and reflects the addition of roughly $800 million to the amounts previously considered for procurement as a result of the decision to budget on the basis of combat consumption rates throughout all of fiscal year 1954 and the first half of fiscal year1955.","military public works 
a total of $400 million is requested in the revised budget for mili­tary public works against existing authorizations, all of which is for the air force.",additional funds to finance newly authorized military public works projects will be requested only to the extent that exist­ing funds cannot be reallocated to meet these needs.,"the funds requested in the revised budget, when used in conjunction with the outstanding unexpended balances of approximately $1.7 billion, will support a high level of military research and development.","4. included in this category are the costs of retired pay, amounting to $375 million; emergency civilian relief in korea, amounting to $75 million; salaries and expenses for the office of the secretary of defense, reduced from $13.9 million to $12.8 million; and the costs of operating certain joint activities in which all 3 military departments have an interest, as well as certain joint schools and boards.",we do not believe that the proposal in the budget document can be made to work to the advantage of the united states insofar as the department of defense is concerned.,"for the purpose of posing the problem at this time, i might add that under the wording of the proposed provision in the january 1953 budget document, the term ""foreign credits received"" might be interpreted to require depositing to the treasury the dollar equivalent of all types of services received by1 agencies of the department of defense.","the department of defense budget for fiscal year 1954 does not include 
funds to cover the equivalent value of such services.","25. 	
the united states has the right to survey, construct, man, and supply certain defense areas with appropriated funds, but the united states is exempt from taxes, customs duties on items of equipment and supplies.","however, the basic decisions which affect nearly all phases of the military budget were not available to the military departments until april 29, and in certain details-not until several days later.","that means, if i understand it, that the department of defense, if we leave the construction item out of the picture, will have had $555 million more in 1953 than appears in the budget; is that correct?",the cost of operating a korean division in combat for a year is approximately $100 million.,"actually there is no question that there is some 
guess in that item reflecting mr. wilson's basic concern that during 
the last war, plants and facilities, and so forth, which were at terrific 
cost built up were then dissipated soon after the war.","mr. secretary, when was the original 1954 budget started so far as consideration was concerned in the department of defense?",the 1954 military budget was initiated in the depart­ment of defense in september of 1952?,the models which were to be included in the original 1954 military budget were determined in the summer of 1952?,"the reduction made by the congress in the military 
budget for fiscal year 1953 was around $4% billion?",so that the reduction made by the congress last year in the military budget had relatively little ell'ect on the overall military target?,"would you give me or the committee an idea of what the new defense administration plans to do in major fields in the matter of, let me say, looking for greater efficiency and reductions in cost and so forth?","based on the build-up or the stretch-out that we are in, and on the thought that we will not go forward too rapidly with the military buildup, could this $36 billion request be rounded off at s30 billion without any catastrophic effect upon our defense budget?","you do not seriously maintain that this $36 billion budget, insofar as aircraft procurement for the navy and the air force is concerned, is not to some extent a stretch-out of our defense program?","the action of the congress and the defense depart­
ment on the budget will further bring down expenditures and further bring down the rate of expenditures.","you talk about the truman budget; truman did not 
make the former military budget, did he?","in other words, the present $36-billion budget is 100 percent that of the secretary of defense and his aides?","the budget, then, was not made with the thought 
that this was what we needed, necessarily, for the defense of this country.","in the first attempt the national security council-i mention that because that includes the secretary of the treasury,the secretary of state, the director of mutual security, and the sec­retary of defense, with a representative of the joint chiefs of staff usually present-the chairman if he is in town or one who takes his place when he is absent-there was first a proposal to attempt to balance the budget or at least to present the problem as to the effect of attempting to balance the budget in 1955.","general, each year we are confronted with a budget of the department of defense.","my under­standing is that the budget was made up principally by civilians; the secretary of defense and particularly the comptroller of the depart­ment of defense, mr. mcneil.","i just want to know to what extent the $36 billion budget represents 
the military viewpoint as to the military requirements of this country.","now, you have already testified the joint c'iifts did not participate in the reduction of the former $41 billion military budget to a $3(j billion military budget.","after that, as you know, before this $36 billion was recommended, it was decided to increase the rok army, the republic of korea army, which it was estimated would cost approximately $2 billion to give initial equipment and support for 1 year.",if we have a war you would probably say that was a dangerous cut.,if you do not have a war it probably will not be said it was a dangerous cut.,"i think the services are best qualified to answer you on that, and for my own opinion, only time will tell how much you can cut that personnel without affecting the combat efficiency of the unit.","reduction in size of military forces 
now, following that announcement of our effort for peace, we announce that we are going to cut the number of men in uniform.","they have to justify that, the particular item, or type of item, first, to the secretary of defense, the bureau of the budget, the president, and then to your committee.","as long as the decision is what it is today-and certainly we should consider costs, casualties, and every­thing else-our action in our opinion, from a military point of view, is right to carry out the present national policy.","well then, i think the congress can assume the dollars called for in the $36 billion budget do not envision a decided military push to bring the korean war to a successful military conclusion; is that correct?","even if it did not precipitate an all-out war, the increase in forces, operational expenses, and munitions and everything else involved in it, in my opinion, would cost more than either of these figures.","the military services attempted to commit these 
funds as rapidly as possible.","therefore, as civilians, we must cease to cut the military to the bone in time of peace, while on the other hand, we permit them to utilize our resources unnecessar­ily in time of war as a result of inflated requirements.","total expenditures for the department of defense, including military assistance programs, will amount during the current fiscal year to a total equal to the com-biped dollar sales of the 22 largest industrial manufacturing corporations in the united states-this means all corporations with individual sales of 1 billion or more in 1952. 
the armed forces now include over 4,800,000 people--3,500,000 military per­sonnel and 1,300,000 civilian employees.","today, the research and development being carried on by the military sub­stantially exceed the total being carried on in the united states by private industry with its own funds.","it is said that surveys and reports discussing the various problems of the military services have cost millions of dollars, and would fill a wing of the pentagon.","with reference to the budget about which my colleagues have interrogated you, general, in your official position, i am assuming that you were consulted so far as the military strategy was concerned, that being a consideration in the formation of the budget.","those were presented by each service to the 
secretary of defense, who had his own comptroller and who had 
representatives of the bureau of the budget in with him.","the statement was made by the secretary of 
defense the other day that 
this budget was arrived at after consultation of all those involved in the 
policymaking including representation of the chiefs of staff.","i am assuming from that statement that somewhere in the scheme 
of the origin of this budget there was consultation by and between the 
secretary of defense or his representatives and the chiefs of staff 
or their representatives.","you also state very frankly that you do not know whether the force levels under the $41 billion budget can be attained under the $36 billion budget, or whether the personnel reductions suggested can be brought about without hurting the combat forces.","if you were convinced that the $36 billion budget will not in fact reduce our combat manpower or our combat equipment in 1954 and 1955 or subsequently, or the other items that you have just referred to but.","you did that during the last war because, if you tried to budget here for future operations, you disclose those operations well in advance of carrying them out.","as i say, we have been severely criticized for making budget assumptions that the war would be over at such and such a time.","the original budget assumed, for budget purposes, that the war would be over by december.","but this time it has been put in for ammunition purposes at least for the army, on the assump­tion that the war will go on through all the fiscal year 1954. as you say, that is one of the reasons why the army's budget was increased over the january figure.","then, based on those two factors which are very perti­nent to the situation in korea, and in that part of the globe, would you say that the new budget would strengthen us in that area?","in the fiscal year 1952, the total department of defense budget requests were $62,195,855,548.","in the fiscal year 1953, the total budget request for the department of defense was $55,078,246,710.",the reductions made in the budget for the fiscal year 1953 for the department of defense were not based on any resub­mission of the budget by the chief executive-is that right?,"in other words, the military, dollarwise, probably would like to have had substantially more funds?","we were given a decision on the amount of money that would go into the defense budget, and then we were directed to break that down and try to get the maximum defense out of that particular figure.","other problems relating to this and requiring study by the commission are the reserve pattern (which at the present time is being built with veterans only) and a review of proposed cost estimates of national security training and its projected savings to the defense effort over a period of years, the idea being that with a large nonveteran reserve the strength of the standing forces can more safely be reduced.","that is one reason why we were able to get along on the small budget, because the question of universal military training for about a year has been quiescent, very quiet.","reduction of costs under universal military training program 
mr. scrivner.","at that time we had cost figures provided us by the defense department, which proved to be faulty.",in this state­ment you say that you are doing a lot of studying about reducing the costs of the universal military training program.,"very definitely unfair to many individuals; because a boy now who is drafted, goes into the service and may spend 2 years in korea or elsewhere, but when he leaves, he goes into the reserve for 6 years more.","543

not included in the cost, but all the other expenses incident to their activities in the office of the secretary of defense, such as their travel expenses, their office equipment and supplies, their telephone expenses, and so forth, are included.","chairman, in developing our original budget we developed some figures on the military personnel and also on costs.","i can give you an example of what that would cost under that plan, if you would prefer to have it that way, or we can furnish you a new statement showing the cost of the 595 military personnel included in this estimate.","we have put into the other contractual service iteni in this budget one single item of $100,000, based upon the recommen­dations contained in the rockefeller committee report that the weapons systems evaluation group should have contract authority similar to the operational analyses groups of the military depart­ments.","now, $100,000 is nowhere near the magnitude of the funds available to the military departments for that purpose, but it is a start.","this estimate will provide the personnel and other necessary expenses required for planning and coordinating the development of department of defense policyand program guidance in these areas, other than for mutual defense assistance matters which are provided for from funds made available under the mutual defense assistance act.","the increase in funds here is to provide the assistant secretary for health and medical with money to seek advice from outside the military establishment, from doctors, dentists, and others on medical and health problems of the department of defense.","however, in an organization as large as the military establishment, involving hundreds of thousands of men, that is not possible within any reason­able length of time, so these manpower totals that were used in the budget figures for the overall operations for 1954 have to be arrived at on the basis of some conclusions.","so we restored 51,000 of the 125,000 and came up with a cut of 74,000. we would allow 5,000 for the marine pipe­line, so the navy figure was brought back 5,000, and they got a cut of 70,000. in the air you have a different picture because there is a service trying to increase its combat effectiveness.","tuesday, june 16, 1953.

opinion that this committee had better keep itself in a position where 
they can have some control over the money they appropriate and get 
away from leaving it to the military to make a cut of their selection.","my friend's observations are as follows: 
""i should like to discuss the question of savings, particularly in the military expenditures.","i shall now quote from this letter: 
i should first like to discuss the question of savings, particularly in the military expenditures.",the american people will not object to the money that they have to spend for defense if they get their money's worth; a dollar's worth of material and service for every dollar that is spent.,"so our problem is, how are we going, or how can we cut defense appropriations, reduce these expenditures, without at the same time weakening our defense or jeopardizing the security of the nation?","and this little extension that we have, based upon the best estimates and assuming the war will neither contract nor expand too much but tlat things will continue as they are now, is going to cost us $538,537,000 in the fiscal year 1954.

Department of Defense Appropriations for 1952. Part 2 Department of the Army.txt,38359,2543,2548,319,"these needs, as reflected in the army's portion of the fiscal year 1952 department of defense budget, now under consideration by your committee, amount to $20,798,846,000.","the amount does not include the army's portion 
of the $4% billion recommended by the president in his budget message of april 30, 1951, for new public works construction, since the.presi­dent has not yet approved a detailed military construction program for fiscal year 1952. 
preparedness objectives 
in december of last year the joint chiefs of staff recommended the military forces that they felt this nation must have by the end of fiscal year 1952 in order to meet the minimum security requirements of the united states under current conditions.","working with the office of the secretary of defense and the bureau of the budget he has subjected these estimates to a searching review for a period of 2 months, to be sure that they financed only minimum needs in line with the army's preparedness objectives and that the proper balance had been maintained between the army's urgent immediate require­ments and its potential long-term needs.","turning from my prepared statement, one of the things i always hoped for as director of the bureau of the budget was that there could be a review and analysis internally of the services' budgets by repre­sentatives of the bureau of the budget, department of defense, and representatives of the individual services rather than the more formal proceeding of not moving the budget into the picture until after the conclusion had been reached in the area of the services' operation.","if we were to undertake to obtain materiel as fast as our factories could make it and at the same time were willing to assume the far greater dollar cost involved in such a program, we could be ready for war at an earlier date.","mindful of the risks involved, the army in the budget now before you has accepted a program which emphasizes the creation of a pro­duction base and its maintenance during the indefinite period of military preparedness that lies ahead.","military forces and personnel 
this budget will maintain the presently planned active army during the fiscal year 1952. to man this army, to provide the soldiers needed to carry out our rotation programs, and to replace the reserv­ists and national guard men now scheduled for release from active duty beginning in september of this year, the army plans to enter and finish fiscal year 1952 with approximately 1% million men.","in fiscal year 1950, military personnel costs accounted for about 40 percent of the budget; in fiscal year 1952, about 21 percent.","the $9,481,000,000 requested in this budget for major procurement
and production, when added to previous appropriations and taldng
into account stocks on hand, will enable us during this coming fiscal 
year to equip with modern arms and maintain the active army and 
its supporting elements, to provide a part of our war reserve of mat6­
riel and, what is most important, to create and maintain an expanded
production base.","it does not, however, make any provision for attri­
tion and combat loss of equipment in korea in fiscal year 1952. nor 
will these procurement funds provide the balance of the war reserve 
which should be on order and in process on d-day in order to cover 
combat consumption during the first year of a maior war 
we are taking the calculated risk that a d-day within the next year
will find us less prepared than if we had chosen to rearm now at topspeed.",i want to emphasize that the funds for new construction to be requested by the army for the coming fiscal year represent only a partial funding of our total military construction requirements and that they include only the minimum amount needed during the coming fiscal year to provide essential additional facilities.,"to provide for attrition and combat loss in korea after 30 june 1951 will, therefore, entail many expenditures for which provision will have to be made through a supplemental budget.","the details of the present budget and an analysis of military require­
ments upon which it is based will be presented to you by officers of the 
general staff who will follow me.","we have chosen at some risk in the proximate future to request, in place of full reserves, the establishment, at less 
cost, of production lines in industry for the manufacture of military equipment.","and i 
wish to emphasize that we in the army are keenly aware of the impli­
cations upon the national economy of these large expenditures neces­
sary for defense.","1 must emphasize at the same time, however, that 
the unpredictable international situation has even greater implications 
in threats to our nation if we do not make these expenditures to 
strengthen our military posture.","for the degree of readiness it is in­tended to produce will obviously be substantially lowered depending on how long the war continues in korea during fiscal year 1952. if materiel consumption in korea is not too heavy, the funds requested will permit us to make a very substantial improvement in the strength and readiness of the army.","careful preparation of 1952 budget 
now, mr. secretary, you stated you are asking $20,798,846,000 for fiscal 1952, plus public works, plus the requirements of the korean war.","there is the cost of the korean war after june 
30. there is the pay-as-you-go program in japan and the pay-as­you-go program in germany.","84328-51-pt 2-z

cost of korean war 
&s to the cost of the korean war, we were not fundamentally able to provide at this time an estimate that i felt was folly accurate, or even accurate enough to present to this committee.",can you tell us what the korean war cost in 1951?,the next question which was asked is what dollar amount in this budget is included for war reserves.,"we, of course, have recognized the necessity of providing funds for expediting production, but we are extremely anxious that that practice be stopped just as soon as possible because it represents an additional expense of defense.","it is true that the present budget which you now 
present to us is not entirely realistic because it does not undertake to 
take into consideration the requirements in korea after july 1, 1951. 
secretary pace.","of course, we do not want to strip ourselves of necessary defense, but when bills are on the floor there is a disposition to offer amendments and try to perfect them-so they say-and there might conceivably be a motion made to cut this bill by 10 percent, 15 percent, or 5 percent.","it has been examined not only originally at our own control level but it has been examined at the department of defense level, and it has been examined by the bureau of the budget from the point of view of eliminating duplications, planning on the utilization of manpower, and so forth.","yet, the secretary of defense and the bureau of the budget and the department of the army and the other services have scaled this down to about $60 billion.","some 20 percent, i believe, of these costs go to either paying or sub­
sisting or giving the necessities of life, as our mothers and brothers of 
soldiers conceive them to be,to that 1,552,000. 
another 45 percent is in the very hard goods which you do not wish 
to cut.","korean war costs 
there is another viewpoint from which a reduction in the army budget below the present figure would be, i think, really disastrous.","we have, as you know, no provision in this budget to speak of-we have a few odd millions-no general provision for the cost of korea.","the cost of korea over and above the normal costs for this fiscal year, if it runs all year, might be about $5 billion, plus or minus 20 percent.","since we do not have the funds here specifically for korea we must 
use either the materiel or the money to support korea.","the requisitions for sleeping bags in korea will run something like 300,000. those are not provided for in the budget, but we have to go out and buy them now if we are to have them next winter.","your point, i take it, is that since we are actually not providing in every sense for the continuation of the war in korea after july 1 these funds are all the more important in order to cushion that demand.","3. sr 600-620-5, personnel economy in utilization: 
""in order that the department of the army may accomplish its priority missions within budgetary limitations, the utmost efficiency in the utilization of both military and civilian personnel must be practiced.",the department was directed to prepare green sheets and an arran ement was made whereby a more simplified form than had been included in the 1951 budget was presented and included in the printed hearings for each appropriation pertaining to the department of defense in the 1951 budget.,"that provision, approved september 12, 1950, caused, even with the material that is now included, a great burden upon the military department, but that mandate of law was complied with 100 percent,and the size of this committee print is the result of inclusion for each appropriation the green sheet data in exactly the same form as it was included in the budget for the fiscal year 1951. 
now, what i have said does not argue for or against breaking the green sheet data down further than it is now in the printed budget, or has been in the past, including 1950 and prior years.","so i am going to approach the problem in just a little different way than mr. mahon did, although i have the same question in my mind, namely: in view of the size of the budget that is involved, in view of the huge mass of details necessary to the budget make-up, and many other factors relating thereto, i should like to have a statement from you-if you cannot give it now, to be furnished later-i should like to know where, if this committee should decide to decrease the budget by the following four amounts-half a billion dollars, $1 billion, which would be 5 percent, $1%billion which would be 7.5 percent, or $2 billion which would be approximately 10 per-cent-where could those cuts be taken with the least hurt to the military program?","(the matter referred to follows:) the army's budget was carefully prepared and based on a balanced program, that is, combat units with their required supporting units, logistic support, and basic establishment.","any reduction in funds of the magnitude under consideration will result in an imbalance of fqrces, and would affect all phases of the army programs; how­ever, it would be impossible to avoid a substantial reduction in combat and supporting units.","if the reduction in funds were applied solely to military units, a one-half billion dollar reduction would result in the elimination of one division 
with its supporting units, while a reduction of $2 billion would cause a reduction in strength of approximately four divisions with their supporting units.","appropriations committee, whether it 
concerns the military or any other activity, i have learned that we 
are always told that this budget presents an irreducible minunum.","as far as this committee is concerned, the ground rules under which you are going to determine what costs are chargeabledirectly to the korean war, as i call it-or conflict as others call it-is not a matter of importance to this committee so much, nor-do i think that it concerns the taxpayers so much, but i do think the com­mittee should be given, before this hearing is over, as sound a figure as possible of the additional burden that the korean war has placed upon the american taxpayer.","cost of continuous preparedness 
now, of course, in the past year apprehension has grown, and i 
was a little taken back by your statement on page 3 where you said: 
at any moment, should the soviet see fit to attack, we may be fighting in 
another world war.","cost of national defense in future years 
mr. scrivner.","i recognize the problem of changing conditions, but my own hope would be that having estab­lished a basis of strength, and having proven a posture indicating to a potential enemy they were not in a sound position to move against us, that we might establish a basis of military expenditures that would not be on the level that we are currently operating under.",the reason i asked the question is that there have been statements emanating from various sources which seemed to be placed with the very idea of conditioning the american public to the idea they 'must look forward to the expenditure of approximately $100 billion a year for defense for a great many years.,"yes, sir; adequate with the definite recognition
of the fact that we are accepting certain risks by not asking for funds 
for the full production of all the equipment that would be needed in 
the event we were certain war was going to happen in the immediate 
future.","general decker has just called 
my attention to the fact, which was stated yesterday when you were 
not here, that we have no money in this budget for the continuation 
of operations in korea after the lst of july.","if this progress is not offset by diversion of accumulating reserve material to meet combat attrition in korea, or if a timely supplemental appropriation is authorized to replace such diverted reserves, this budget will permit further substantial gains toward the desired goal.","engineer service, army 
the $1,201,049,000 requested for fiscal year 1952 for the appro­priation ""engineer service, army"" is 78 percent of the amount appropriated for fiscal year 1951. increases in the requirements for real estate activities, repair and maintenance of engineer military equipment, storage and issue of engineer military supplies and equip­ment, military surveys and maps, the operation of engineer schools, and engineer field training have been offset by decreases in funds for procurement of engineer military supplies and equipment, and for army repairs and utilities.","this amount is 40 percent of the sum appropriated for this purpose in fiscal year 1951. 
military construction, army 
in the appropriation ""military construction, army,"" are included costs of acquisition and construction of real property.","for these activities $1,210,535,000 is requested in 1952. this is an increase of approximately 16 percent over 1951. the increase is due to: extended maintenance in storage and inspection of materiel for replenishment issue to the expanded army; increased replenishment of spare parts, resulting from the needs of the expanded army as well as increased costs of spare parts; increase in utilization of light aircraft, with the resultant activation of additional aircraft main­tenance units; increase in the activity of ordnance procurement dis­tricts in order to implement the expanded procurement program; and additional training requirements and training aids due to expansion of the army and to the new types of materiel being procured for issue 
to army troops.","due to the ordering into active federal military service of both units and individuals of the reserve components, some savings have accrued in the funds provided in fiscal year 1951; availability of these funds has served to reduce 1952 estimates.","national guard 
estimates for the national guard budget total $203,002,000 and 
provide for an end strength of 320,000; this will permit a strength of 
100 percent officers and 50 percent enlisted for all units presently 
organized, or authorized for organization, excluding those in active 
federal military service.","organized reserve corps 
the organized reserve corps budget estimates total $106,536,000 and provide for an end strength of 205,000; this number will permit a strength of 100 percent officers and 50 percent enlisted for the ""early ready"" combat and service support units; a strength of approxi­mately*60 percent officers and cadre enlisted (20 percent) for the remaining units, and will also provide for 24,000 augmentation personnel.","expediting production 
the funds requested in the appropriation ""expediting production"" 
amount to $1,100,000,000 these funds are to be applied to expand 
the production capacity required to provide military items to meet 
the present and foreseeable needs of the armed forces and, at the, 
same time, to broaden the production base to meet potential mobili­
zation requirements.","this necessary production capacity has been 
provided, in part, by funds made available in this appropriation ,during fiscal year 1951. it is planned to utilize the major portion of the funds for the reha­
bilitation, conversion or expansion of existing production facilities ,owned or controlled by the government, and for the conversion of privately owned facilities by the installation of government-owned equipment so that these supply sources will be able to provide items peculiar to military needs or to expand capacity beyond that needed to fill normal peacetime civilian requirements.",a minor portion of the funds are to be utilized for the construction of new plants for manufacture of highly special­ized items peculiar to military uses and not readily convertible to civilian peacetime production.,"civilian relief in korea 
for the appropriation ""civilian relief in korea,"" the department of the army is requesting $50 million for fiscal year 1952, the same amount that was appropriated for fiscal year 1951. the projected use of these funds is: 
[inmluolos of dollars] foodstuffs-22.","industrial mobilization 
industrial mobilization activities for fiscal year 1952 are estimated at $75.1 million, as compared to the $150.7 million made available thus 
far in fiscal year 1951. in addition to this latter sum, it is expected that $6.9 million from the secretary of defense emergency fund will be made available to the army signal corps for joint army, navy, and air force electronic components, bringing the total for fiscal year 1951 to $157.7 million.","as the army members who have preceded me have testified, additional costs arising from combat operations, or other contingencies, will necessitate the submission of supplementary estimates when the intensity and duration of such operations can be determined.","comparison of total fund distribution 
i note in your chart, which gives a very helpful comparison of the distribution of funds by appropriation title for the army in 1950 and 1951 and the proposal for 1952, you have shown a total of $4.4 billion for 1950, $19.3 billion for 1951, and $20.8 billion for 1952. however, from your statement, i judge this figure of $20.8 billion for 1952 is not a real comparison with prior years, because it does not include public works and it does not include what we assume would be the additional costs for carrying on the korean war.","that is correct, providing the korean war con­
tinues and some of the other contingencies we have mentioned ma­
terialize 
mr. sikes we realize the figures you have presented to us are based on known costs you feel you must have provided for.","89 

establishment of war reserve in 1952 budget 
mr. sikes.",in an amount comparable to the amount which will go into war reserve out of 1952 funds?,"there is a small amount of money in the 1951 budget which will go into war reserve, but it will be very difficult to identify just how much.","but if the korean war were to continue, the war reserve which you anticipate being able to build up will be dissipated by the korean war requirements unless we provide supplemental funds?",that is the cost of a composite combat ration.,the primary purpose of providing funds for civilian relief in korea is to prevent disease and unrest in the rear of combat troops.,the post exchange actually reduces the appropriated funds because the profits from the post exchanges are used to provide recrea­tion or necessary services to the soldier which otherwise would be pro­vided as a result of appropriated funds.,"medical 1,410,935 1,410,935 1, 051, 100 84, 00

the support of our troops stationed in the zone of the interior.","with the increased deployment of troops to the european command, austria, far east command, and caribbean, additional support personnel have been included in the fiscal year 1952 budget.","there are two principal reasons for this: first, the assumption upon which this budget was based-that due to the un­certainty of conditions in korea, no specific requirements for that area m the nature of supplies were included in the computation of our depot workload; second, by june 30, 1951, we will have nearly reached our peak military strength and the supplies, other than normal peace­time maintenance, will have already been distributed from the depot system to the local warehouses.","in order to present an over-all picture of the increasing numbers of the military and civilian personnel paid from the military appropri­ations, we have prepared this chart which shows the military man-year strength on which the fiscal year 1950 budget, was computed, the in­creased military man-year strength estimates for fiscal year 1951, and the planned strength for fiscal year 1952. the chart also shows the 
corresponding civilian personnel man-year increase.","the fiscal year 1952 budget now before you provides for a beginningand terminal strength of 1,552,000 troops for an average strength of 1,531,200. while the beginning and ending strengths are the same as the projected terminal strength for fiscal year 1951, the average or man-year strength to be financed is greater by approximately 442,000. comparison of the strengths by identity is as follows:

during this year, however, we have had to reactivate many new stations, take care of about a 100-percent expansion in the troop strength and i still think that we are doing a pretty good job under this project considering that there has been a rather sizable increase in cost of travel since 1949 
for example, as the colonel pointed out, the joint travel regulation authorized an increase from a maximum of $7 to a maximum of $9 in military per diem.","in 1951 we are going from ap­
proximately 593,000 troops to 1,552,000, with a considerable increase 
in organizational movements and overseas deployment, which has 
increased the cost of this project tremendously, particularly since 
most movements are from west coast ports.","they were further reviewed at the secretary of defense level, and

the funds included for ordnance training requirements-$9,886,­000-are small when compared to the dollars, time, and lives saved in providing trained ordnance technicians to service the equipment of combat troops and in providing skilled civilian technicians to expedite 
the production, maintenance, and issue of ordnance equipment.","funds are included in this project for the operation of the ordnance schools for military personnel, special training courses for civilian employees, army-wide training aids, and for the continued operation of the ordnance board.","funds for the development and procurement of mechanical-training aids and instructional items necessary in the training of troops in the use and maintenance of weapons, tanks, and guided missiles are included in this project.","we have not produced any m-1 rifles since world war ii, and this item is a good example of the requirement for industrial preparedness funds.","but with priorities that have to be given to much more urgent projects such as the support in korea and the procure­ment program; and, tying the program in with all other agencies, it has not been possible to move as fast as was anticipated over a year ago.","but budgetwise we would have to have additional funds to support the consumption in korea during fiscal 1952. 
mr. mahon.","i may say for the record, at this point, that when we got into the korean war, representatives from the department of defense came before the committee and said they were going to have to resort to varying techniques in order to get going on the high-prior­ity items and then later on we would be called upon to fill in the deficit.","we can give you the world war ii cost on the m-1 rifle and also a modification of the springfield rifle, which we call the 1903-a3.","$31 was the cost with accessories during the war, according to the august 1945 supply control.","actually, during comparable months in world war ii, we paid the contractors who were producing the m-1903-a3 (springfield) more than either the commercial or ordnance cost of the 
m-1.",i hope in our standardization program we do not cut down the number of men in combat units in european forces to a level comparable to ours and put the rest of their troops to filling out forms.,by what line of reasoning are you sure that you can justify a request for these funds on the basis of these items being essential and actually usable in combat?,"if we lose vehicles in a military operation, the cost will really go skyrocketing.","mr. engel used to be the chairman of the military subcommittee on appropriations, and i know he, as well as other members of the subcommittee, was very much interested in the gadgets that were put on the jeep, and it was felt that a lot of gadgets were put on the jeep for use in noncombat areas that were not required and they added greatly to the cost.",yet you have not been able to sell a bill of goods to the department of defense or the bureau of the budget.,this is definitely an austerity budget from the stand­point of what we would require if we got in-to an all-out war.,the net effect of the imposition of this tax would be increased costs of administration by the department of defense and the treasurydepartment.,"the jeeps included in the navy 1952 
budget are for advance base units and combat operation exclusively, and therefore required a mounted winch.","the fund requirement under this heading is to provide for the opera­tion of the 14 ordnance districts engaged in activities in connection with the procurement of standard ordnance materiel and ordnance research and development projects, including the location of suitable sources of supply, negotiation, preparation and execution of formal contracts together with administration, inspection, acceptance and payment in connection therewith; and to provide inspection service for arsenals, other districts and other departments of the national military establishment.","increase in funds of $4,400,000 is attributable to required supply

and budget requests 
i note that the increase in the request for funds has proceeded very vapidly.","in ad­dition, our program for 1951 included the korean combat situation, which also had a big effect on our spare-parts procurement, represent­ing a large portion of this budget.","when we reach the point where we must buy 60 percent, as we are in 1952, of the actual individual line items of spare parts which we issue to troops, and consider that we are supporting greater densities of materiel in the army with usage factors which are larger because 
of the expanded and intensified training programs, we can account for the big increase in project 410, which represents a large portion of the p-400 series budget estimate.","the propelling charges, for illustration, during world war ii were bagged in cotton bags because the japs cut off our supply of silk.","in this project the parts we budget for are for those vehicles in use, including all tactical vehicles, combat and transport, and the so-called commercial-type items.","general ford we would very much hesitate to make any cut in the training of our ordnance soldiers, because their training is essential in providing necessary support to the combat troops in the field.","when the budget had received its normal review and was ready for submission to the department of defense, its size was such that it was decided to make a second review.",at the same time utilization of these funds is held to a mini­mum consistent with the objectives to be attained both as to military preparedness and maintenance of civilian item production with the minimum possible degree of interference.,"the need for such flexibility has in the past been justified both in world war ii and during the present emergency to provide for changing requirements based on combat experience, need for rapid production capacity due to newly developed and proven items, need for improving design of existing equipment, and similar conditions which prevent firm determination of facility requirements in advance as is necessary in the usual procedures for budget purposes.","90,029  79,943  50,000  19 22s  

of the above amounts authorized for government-owned plants, the major portion of authorized funds will be expended for rehabilita­tion of those plants constructed during world war ii and held in reserve since that time with minimum maintenance.","so that proper utilization of these funds in the best interest of the government and for maximum advantage to the defense effort is assured, rigid controls have been established by the secretary of the army.",we want this money here to provide us not only with funds to meet our current production but to provide a base from which we can begin a war if we must do that.,"then, if some of these tools are to be used only in the event of a major war, if funds for those tools are not voted at this time, it will not affect the present production; is that correct?","the building was built in the last war with government funds and sold after the war to general motors with the national security clause allowing us to recapture it in time of emergency, and that has been done.","present budget represents peak cost short of war

mr. mahon.",and of the money appropriated to the chemical service during world war ii approximately how much money was spent-and some of the funds were expended at the conclusion of hostilities?,"how much of the money appropriated and expended during world war ii-and i would consider world war ii as begin­ning in fiscal 1941-had to do with expenditures in connection with poison gas warfare, and the type of warfare which we actually did not wage.",i want to contrast those expenditures for the poison-gas type of warfare with other types of warfare and with expenditures that were made and appropriations that were made in connection with the type of thing that was actually done in promoting defense.,"what percentage of the funds in this budget, totaling the sum of $123,000,000 have to do with, more or less, the type of warfare which was car­ried on during world war ii?","i did not bring any criteria on that because that comes under the construction budget, but this school was built during world war i, and it was slightly added to in world war i. 
mr. scrivner.",continuation of these new items into procurement proceeded on a very limited scale prior to korea due to lack of funds.,these also represent a substantial payoff from the post world war ii research and development funds.,"our total request for 1952, in round figures, is $377.5 million, of 
which $365 million represents estimated direct research and develop­
ment costs of the department of the army and the balance of $12.5 
million constitutes the r. & d. requirements of special field activities, 
a joint project of the three military services.","the budget presented for 1952 generally will complete 
the testing and modification of a basic road, rail, and marine fleet 
for the army which will permit the transportation corps efficiently 
to move supplies, equipment and troops to and within any potential 
theater of operation.","the army medical service research and develop­ment program will require $10 million in 1952, which represents an increase of $3 million over the budget for fiscal year 1951, and $6.4 million over that of 1950 this program is designed to develop better methods of maintaining and restoring the health of troops in order to conserve fighting manpower under all the extreme conditions imposed by war.","lest the impression be created that our entire program is concentrated on the development of weapons and equip­ment, i wish to refer briefly to the personnel research and development program of the adjutant general, also financed from quartermaster funds which is designed to increase the effectiveness of the individual soldier.","funds included for the chemical corps amount to $24.8 million required to carry out its primary responsibility for the entire department of defense of research and development in the 
fields of chemical, biological, and radiological warfare.","sizable amounts are also included in the ordnance budget for the development of automotive and combat vehicles, new artillery wea­pons, both field and antiaircraft, ammunition of all kinds, cannon and recoil mechanisms, grenades, mines, fuzes, and warheads.",the 66 percent of our budget which is allocated to the ordnance corps is consistent with the major combat role which must be assumed by ground troops in any war of the foresee­able future.,"as already mentioned, one of the aids in meeting the ground soldier's requirements for the foreseeable future is the army equipment development guide, which establishes the fields of development and the item requirements on which the major portion of research and development funds should be expended.","the operational categories, as established by the research and development board are: land combat airborne landing
air defense basic research 
supporting research amphibious operationspersonnel operations strategic air operations supply and maintenance operations psychological and cold war operationschemical warfare antisubmarine operations 
intelligence operations combat air operations
biological warfare sea combat operations 
atomic warfare 
you will note that the three largest of these categories are land com­bat, air defense, and supporting research, which together represent70 percent of the total 1952, budget.","in closing, i would like to call attention to the fact that the $365 
million requested for direct research and development costs amounts 
to only 28 percent of the total research and development budget of the 
department of defense, and represents only 2 percent of the total 
army budget.",i believe i can say it dis­tinctly and succinctly in just one sentence: the aim of research and development is national defense at lowest cost.,"nevertheless, the dollar mark is still ever before us because the cost of weapons in dollars is directly proportional to national effort, and national effort is never scarcer than in time of war.","we have not only reduced the cost, made it so the soldier can do his task more swiftly, economically, and effectively, but we have also created an important hedge against the shortage of, strategic and critical materials.","did you delay the formulation of your budget in any way or, rather, the presentation of your budget to congress or the formula­tion of it by-reason of the developments in korea?","is korea to some extent a blessing, even though it might be in disguise and even though it is terribly expensive in the cost of lives and so forth, by reason of the lessons we are learning?","costs of military equipment 
mr. mahon.","i understand you do not fight wars with cadillacs, but how can you put enough stuff in a tank to make it cost $240,000?",of course this cost is just one of many when it comes to military procurement.,"as a result our productioncosts are not truly comparable with world war ii prices, but represent a further increase in production costs because of the course we have deliberately chosen.","if the world war ii tank had cost $100,000, then today we would expect it to cost us $200,000, merely because of increases in wages and price of materials next, if the new tank weighed 1.55 times as much as the world war ii tank, the price could reasonablybe expected to be $310,000 (multiplying the $200,000 by 1.55) and that would be true only if we were producing in the volume attained during world war it now the fact is that instead of $310,000 our comparative hypothetical price is 
$300,000, or less than the calculated one, without the aid of mass production.","i have raised this question before, and i will raise it again, because somewhere in some of my reading of either official or semiofficial papers the statement was made that 75 percent of the ammunition procured in world war ii was not used in combat, and i think they included training, but, at least, for the purpose of my statement, for combat, which means that there was the overpro­curement of an item that ran into a terrific amount of money, because these shells cost a lot of money.","we got that from the emergency fund, office 
secretary of defense.","in answer to a question by mr. riley you said that you were 
constantly trying to get things cheaper; but, as we look over the -cost figures of all the items of procurement over a period of years, 
i fail to detect that lower cost 
colonel petzing sir, if you will compare the production costs of standard equipments which were purchased during the war, and are still standard and being purchased now, you will see the prices there have gone way up also.","(the matter referred to follows)

(1) 
the dispatch of a field unit to korea which obtained much valuable combat data which would otherwise have been lost; and 

(2) 
the early adoption of a balanced program of operations research, which is reflected above.","this increase 
in funds will permit oro to pursue its balanced program of research 
commensurate with the over-all army mission and will provide for a 
continuation of the small field research unit in korea.","even tdday our soldiers are developing an average of two to four new cavities per man per year, and losing collectively well over a million teeth per year the cost of these dental treatments at conservative civilian rates exceeds $80 million.","the budget as presented for fiscal year 1952 generally will complete the testing and modification of a basic rail and marine fleet for the army which will permit the transportation corps to move supplies, equipment, and troops to and within any potential theater of opera­tion.","it is not like they were going in as professional military men and making a career of it and maybe 2 years, 3 years, or 5 years did not cut so much ice, but in a situation like this i think the regulations should be more just than they presently seem to be.",the members of the committee and the members of congress have been most anxious to facilitate every economy in the department of defense with respect to personnel and with respect to funds.,"in some of the smaller ones, such as the indoctrination courses in alaska, it is primarily a question of per diem for each officer involved and the travel is usually by military plane, so there is no cost for that.","886

it might be mentioned at this point that 54 percent of this budget estimate is for civilian employees and a substantial portion of the increased funds received in fiscal year 1951 and the further increases requested in fiscal year 1952 are directly attributable to our continuing efforts to, divert a larger portion of our military strength into combat units and utilize civilians in administrative and housekeeping jobs.","funds for army field forces were increased by 65 percent in fiscal year 1951 and the fiscal year 1952 request is 114 percent above fiscal year 1950. this increase includes funds for 98 civilians to replace military personnel, 52 of whom have already been replaced and 46 of whom are to be replaced in fiscal year 1952. 
combat arms schools 
the next three activities are our combat arms schools and they reflect the largest increases of any of the various activities.","the infantry school costs increased 133 percent in fiscal year 1951 and the amount requested in fiscal year 1952 is 202 percent over fiscal year 1950. nearly all of the 1952 increase is for personal serv­ices, including 100 additional employees of which 90 are for replace­ment of military.","operating costs of these two schools increased 217 percent in fiscal year 1951, and the fiscal year 1952 request is 431 percent above the pre-korean level of fiscal year 1950. 
some $400,000 of the fiscal year 1952 increase is for personal services, including 81 additional employees, of which 38 are for replacement of military.","it might be mentioned that the student enrollment at the artillery school this year has been triple that of fiscal year 1950 and at the antiaircraft and guided missile school it has been more than double that of a year ago, and the enrollment will be even greater at both schools in fiscal year 1952. 
the increase in funds for the armored school has been considerably smaller than at the other schools, largely because it was not possible to zvplace as many military personnel with civilians.","the student load at this school has increased from 539 a year ago to 930 on may 26 and is expected to reach nearly 1,900 in fiscal year 1952. 
under ""joint colleges"" are included funds for the national war 
college and the industrial college of the armed forces.","the added employees gre primarily replacements of military, but fort riley, being in an area of a limited labor market, the process of making replacements is rather slow, we have asked for an increase of 142 civilians in our 1952 budget, all of whom are to re­place military personnel.",the budget structure for the army approved bythe office of the secretary of defense and the bureau of the budget includes a separate appropriation for construction for the civilian components.,i believe the decision was made by the secretary of defense and the bureau of the budget.,one-hundred-thousand-odd troops have gone into active service and have not been in their own quarters and using funds from this appropriation?,"on the capitalization of the appraised value of the clothing and equipment for the individual soldier we had a considerable stock of items in the depot which has been taken back into the capitalization fund, and our merchandise holdings have thus been reduced to zero, but we must have money in here to back up our reorganization that is coming up in this fiscal year for the anticipated growth of the guard, and that is a cost which we have tiot had before this year.","project 423-maintenance,operation, and administrative expenses oj the organized reserve corps for other than active duty training

the fiscal year 1952 fund request exceeds the latest fiscal year 1951 funding program for the primary reason that civilian employee support of military district headquarters, which in fiscal years 1950 and 1951 was included in the appropri­ation ""finanse service, army,"" has been transferred for 1952 into this project of the organized reserve corps budget estimate.",this project provides funds for the maintenance of proficiency flying by ground liaison pilots through the contractual rental of civilian aircraft; and also for instruction in foreign languages for military intelligence reserve officers.,"i might qualify that to the extent that we do operate with the budget and in the preparation of its defense, and recommend the funding program.",appropriations estimates prepared by the bureau of the budget for the depart­ment of defense and recently submitted to congress placed certain limitations on first-year army and air rotc enrollments.,"mr. chairman and members of the committee, we are presenting today a portion of the fund requirements for sup­port of the army national guard under a new and separate appro­priation title: ""military construction, army civilian components.""",it is my understanding it is a reduction effected by the bureau of the budget and the department of defense.,"the budget which the department of the army has submitted has been based upon the facts (1) that the geographical area covered in­cludes the whole of south korea, with a population of better than 20 million persons, including some 4 million refugees, and (2) that hostili­
1053 
ties may continue through fiscal year 1952. the requirements are 
conservative and will meet only minimum essentials.","well, we all recognize that we cannot foresee what may happen in korea during the fiscal year, and, generally, the military people have been asking us for no funds to carry on the korean war after july 1. now, upon what basis do you make this request for $50,000,000, that the korean war will continue or end, or what?","i believe the essential assumption in limiting this appropriation to less than half the calculated requirements is that we are not alone in korea, but are only one of the united nations operat­ing there, and we should not bear alone the cost of relief.",i have included the complete cost of putting the items down in korea.,"is it reasonable for me to assume that, while in the general presentation of the budget up to 
date the military has not projected itself beyond june 30, this par­ticular type of function for the relief 'aspect that we are presently considering will undoubtedly be carried on beyond that date?",there was before the bureau of the budget an amount of money that was requested for the united nations organi­zation to do a job in korea at the cessation of hostilities.,"i had contemplated, because the indication was at one time the military would be responsible for the same type of work that eca has been previously doing, with respect to this sustaining type to import the raw material which they could fabricate for immediate use; but, while it is in here as a require­ment, we are not asking funds to cover it, because we have been restricted on that.

are being obtained to meet mobilization needs will have to be diverted 
to support this conflict.","when its intensity and duration can be 
firmly estimated, supplementary funds must be provided to support

in 1952 represents less than 25 percent of the estimated minimum cost 
of the program.","this denoted a substantial increase for the army national guard in com­parison to the amount received for fiscal year 1950 but was $12 million less than the air national guard received in fiscal year 1950. 
the budget estimates, now before you, provide for a year-end strength of 320,000, which is 30,000 less than the strength authorized for fiscal year 1951. this reduction in strength comes about due to the numbers of the army national guard now in the active military service of the united states, but takes into consideration the additional units now in process of organization or to be organized.","while admittedlythis change in budgetary procedure has considerable justification,especially in light of the current readjustment for military production coupled with the realization that all major items of military equipment and material must be made quickly available to the armed forces with the army national guard participating in its priority and, fur­ther, because of the present critical situation with reference to medical and hospital services which justify their inclusion in the budget for medical services, nevertheless, the national guard does not feel that all of the changes are completely necessary.",the national guard voices no objection to the change in budget procedure as it relates to the procurement of items of major equipment and medical and hos­pital services during the present emergency so long that such changedprocedure is recognized to be purely temporary and that normal bud­geting procedures will be restored when the army and air national guard of the united states in the active military service of the united states are returned to state control.,"comparative costs

the format for a revised army budget has been approved by the 
'department of defense and the bureau of the budget.","section 1 of the report contains a detailed 
description of the activities to be included under each of the new 
accounts and budget programs 
the first of the eight appropriations included under the revised 
budget structure is entitled ""military personnel, army,"" as the 
title implies, this appropriation consists principally of all pay, travel, 
food, clothing, and welfare requirements of military personnel.","maintenance and operation of summer camps and similar activities under the present appropria­tion, which constitute about 35 percent of the total, will be included under the new appropriation ""maintenance and operations, army,"" where it belongs, to permit proper administration of related func­tions; the revised structure as contained in section 3 of the report clearly illustrates where the major portion of funds available to the army are being spent-21 7 percent of the army's funds are required for military personnel; 26.0 percent for maintenance of the establish­ment and 48.7 percent for purchase of hard goods.","the functional character­istics of the new structure are clearly illustrated in classification of funds m the new appropriations by object of expenditure for example, about 75 percent of the funds under the appropriation ""military personnel, army"" represents the object class personal services (01) which is principally military personnel; for the appro­priation ""maintenance and operations, army"" supplies and materials 
(08) is the object of expenditure which will register the largest use of funds; while equipment (09) comprises about 75 percent of funds under the appropriation ""procurement and production, army.""","twenty months ago i came here at the request of secretary gray for 6 months, and when i came here i did not like this proposed structure a bit; i came here not liking the proposal; i was accustomed to the other way, having been here on occasions for short tours and long ones during the war off and on, and after spending that period of time in reviewing it, i can see two advantages.","it is not alone mathematical factors you are going 
to have to deal with, but you are going to have to have a lot of acquaint­
ance from the secretary of defense and all of the other echelons that 
issue instructions all the way down the line for the purpose of this 
thing, or it will blow up in your face just like the other thing it is not just a budget concept within itself to make it work, but it has to go from the top and everybody has to get out and work, and they have not been doing it.","you are presentinghere a revision of the army's budget, and is it contemplated by those in authority in the defense secretary's office-and that is where i am looking for the answers and that is where they should come from under the law-that all of the services are going to use one program of procedure in the matter of their budget presentation to congress, or are they going to use, as is done currently, two or 
three?","there are a lot of things we do not get, and with the budget coming to us as late as it did this year, and with the pressures upon us to get this bill out and reported to the house so that it can be passed on and so that the senate can pass on it, to finally get some money available for the military forces, we have not had the time to go into a lot of details which we should have had.","i think the money you give us for military pay and for food and clothing ought to be used for that, because that is pres­ently tied in to a force of 3y2million men and such funds should not be used for any other purpose.","(the following statement was supplied:) 
at present the subappropriation ""pay of the army"" includes funds to pay 
civilians at military headquarters as well as the pay of troops.","as another example, the funds presently 
appropriated for ""subsistence of the army"" are also available for buying equip­
ment for sales commissaries, for feeding foreign civilian employees, and other 
purposes not directly related to feeding the troops.","not only can funds now be 
transferred between these functions, but in theory the money justified for feeding 
soldiers could be spent for one of the other purposes and then a deficit could be 
incurred in the appropriation to feed the troops.","similarly funds would be limited to the purpose or activity pre­scribed for each of the appropriations listed below: military personnel, armymaintenance and operations, armyprocurement and production, armyresearch and development, army

secretary johnson, we are happy to welcome you and others from the defense establishment helre this afternoon for the purpose of pre­senting to us the additional requests for funds for the department of defense.","i know of no better summation of these problems than, the one which your chairman, george mahon, made on the floor of the house in support of this committee's recom­mended budget for 1950. you will recall that on that occasion, chair­man mahon said: 
""if war comes soon, we are approprating too little.","the $3,481,000,000 which secretary forrestal recommended, when added to the 1949 budget as originally submitted, gave a total recom­muended military budget of $13,,507,000,000 for tie fiscal year 1949. in other words,'ile dilemma presented by the competing ntilitary and economic consideration was resolved at the 13 billion level.","i call thi filetto yollr nttntlon* * * beunlis i think thlit itcolltllues

that have been accomplished pursuant to the provisions of this act.""","the mission of the committee is to bring about progressively better use of defense dollars through elimination of nonessential expenditures, and through imiproved 1mn.","agement, in order to release funds for increasing combat effectiveness, and to provide opportunities to curtail over-all costs.","we can goto the floor of the 1house, and the other body can take action over there, and i think we can get additional funds if you need them for the defense of this country.","as pointed out, the cost of the korean war will certainly vary, and i point out there may be further requests with respect to tie buldig up of the basic stricture of the military establishlment, which niay be necessary in tle future.","general bradley, the question has been presented to the secretary of defense and to the joint chiefs, the representatives of the three services, as to whether or not this fund requested here of $10,500,000,000 is adequate now under the facts and circumstances.","the question is not, will you later on request and need additional funds, because we cannot predict the future and we do not believe you can with complete accuracy, but the question is, is this enough money for congress to appropriate at this time for the korean situation and for the improvement of the military )osture of the country?","a.iount of supplemental funds to be used for korea

based on a concept of over-all defense and not oti a concept of one-service defeilse.","will the funds we are now asked to appro)riate take

the supplemental estimate for ""category i, military personnel 
costs,"" is $475,269,489.","military personnel costs include costs for all regular officers and enlisted personnel, reserves on extended active duty with regular forces and reserves on continuous active duty for training reserve forces.","these costs include ""pay and allowances,""

ig production; (d) approximately $490,000,000 for modernization of equipment.","no money is included for those items in the arny budget, since it is understood that a lmnp-sum appropriation for activities iln these fields will be made to the secretary of defense, with later alloa.","the over-all importance of these activities is so great, tmat close coordination by agencies of the office of the secretary of defense is necessary in order to insure the best use of funds which can be made available.","however, when you get into the field of computing the costs of the operations in korea those must be based on tn estimate of what those forces will be and what the operations are that will be conducted.","we have asked the munitions boards to ask for voluntary steel allo-cations, or allocations under mandatory order and priority, as maybe necessary to effect war production.","is there general indication, insofar as it is presently

require such a fund but our chief of staff had and used one.","i recall before the war he was building a barracks at a 
cost of $73,000 which cost about $9,000 out at camp dix or camp
meade.","i have some figures that were 
submitted to me by the department of defense, and they indicate 
considerable balances in some funds.","the estimate for funds necessary in supporting a task force includes onlysuch costs as are in excess of the normal peacetime requirements of this force, such as the difference between the normal and combat rations, estimate of combat losses pilferage, deterioration and other losses, all of which are based on world war ii experience factors.","the funds required for expansion of the army have been computed on the basis of peacetime operation less the application of available assets, whereas the estimate for support of a task force includes only the additional costs incidental to such support, such as estimated combat losses.","in computing the estimate-for personnel en, gaged in maintenance and laundry activities, the salaries of indigenous personnel in japan and korea are included as a direct charge againstthis appropriation instead of being considered as available from the economy of the country as was done in the regular estimate for 1951. 
incidental expenses 
the estimate of funds considered necessary for the expansion of the army amounts to $19,591,994, and the estimate for the cost of supporting the task force has been computed at $13,434,285.","the estimate of funds required for disposition of remains is based 
on the principle of battlefield burial in the combat area, but covers 
requirements for disposition of remains for the expanded army accu­mulated in other areas.","that, obviously,cannot be the money for the men themselves; it must be for filling 
up the pipeline to korea and the extra costs of that type.just what are those extra costs that make the figure run into extra

of defense, the department of the army, civilians, parents of soldiers, the churches, the press, and the country generally.i am prepared to explain and justify each item of the budget to the eent you desire.",i would like to )oiitt out to this coiniiiittee that tile funds included ill these estimates for major proc'reinent cover only it ems of combat equipment and aniinunit iou.,no funds are included for items of a commercial nature or items which will not le used iin direct supportof our combat troops.,"since the war, and by reason of the fact that congresshas made funds available, we have been able to staff these district offices and to have them on the job negotiating contracts, administer­ing contracts, and handling the inspection jobs, and we will expand on that, and we think we have that in good shape.","funds in the amount 
of $14,954,226 are for the procurement of items not available in stock to fill shortages in the units being sent to korea, and in the new units being activated

of the mutual defense e 
assistance act, as amended, would unduly restrict (ite administ rat ion of the greatly expanded european production program contemplated in the request currently before congress.","tihe section prohibits, however, the use of funds (a) to construte or aid in the con­struction of any factory outside of the 1ited states, (b) to provide equipment
