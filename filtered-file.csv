$11,721,000,000, OR 28 PERCENT OF THE BUDGET, OF WHICH $9,304,000,000

$2,417,000,000 COVERS THE COST OF FOOD, INDIVIDUAL CLOTHING, TRANS­
PORTATION, AND OTHER MILITARY PERSONNEL COSTS.","THIS IS ABOUT $200

1953, IF ACCOUNT IS TAKEN OF THE COSTS OF THE MILITARY PAY INCREASE, 
MUSTERING-OUT PAY, AND COMBAT DUTY PAY VOTED AT THE END OF THE LAST 
SESSION OF CONGRESS.","DESPITE THIS DECREASE IN FUNDS, AVERAGE STRENGTH WAS 
EXPECTED TO INCREASE FROM APPROXIMATELY 3,559,000 MAN-YEARS IN 
FISCAL YEAR 1953 TO 3,655,000 MAN-YEARS IN FISCAL YEAR 1954. 
THE FUNDS REQUESTED IN THE 1954 BUDGET FOR MILITARY PAY AND ALLOWANCES ARE BASED UPON EXISTING PAY RATES APPLIED TO THE PLANNED STRENGTHS JUST OUTLINED.","OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE 
TEN BILLION, THREE-HUNDRED AND SIXTY-EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS REQUESTED IN THE 1954 BUDGET, OR 25 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, AND INSTALLATIONS OF THE DEPART­MENT OF DEFENSE.","THIS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY PLANT AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE, THAT HAS BEEN EFFECTED WITH FUNDS PROVIDED IN PREVIOUS YEARS.","RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
THE FISCAL YEAR 1954 BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TOTAL $1,778,000,000, OF WHICH $203 MILLION CONSISTS OF INDIRECT RE­SEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, COMPARED WITH $1,664,000,000 IN 1953 AND $1,499,000,000 IN 1952. IN DEVELOPING THE ESTIMATES RE­LIANCE WAS PLACED ON THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO ELIMI­NATE UNDESIRABLE DUPLICATION, TERMINATE UNPROMISING EFFORT, ASSURE THAT THE MOST PROMISING PROJECTS WOULD RECEIVE SUPPORT, AND TO KEEP THE MILITARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AT A REASONABLE LEVEL.","IN ADDITION, SOME PART OF THE FUNDS MAY BE USED TO ACQUIRE AND ""MOTHBALL"" EXISTING PRIVATELY OWNED FACILITIES, NOW EN­GAGED IN PRODUCTION OF POTENTIAL ""BOTTLENECK COMPONENTS"" OF KEY MILITARY ITEMS, BUT WHICH MAY BE CONVERTED FROM MILITARY PRODUCTION AND LOST AS PART OF THE MOBILIZATION BASE BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO KEEP THE FACILITIES PRODUCING MILITARY ITEMS ONCE IMMEDIATE REQUIRE­MENTS HAVE BEEN MET.","ESTABLISHMENT-WIDE ACTIVITIES

WITH THIS BACKGROUND, IT WAS DECIDED THAT ONE OF THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT TASKS OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WAS AN IMMEDIATE REVIEW OF THE 1954 BUDGET SUBMITTED BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND DETERMINATION OF THE STEPS THAT COULD BE TAKEN IN PROCEEDING TOWARD ACCOMPLISHMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE, WHILE PROVIDING FOR A CON­TINUING INCREASE IN EFFECTIVE MILITARY STRENGTH OVER WHAT EXISTS TODAY.","examination of defense programs and expenditures

OF THE $4% BILLION RECOMMENDED BY THE PRESIDENT IN HIS BUDGET MESSAGE OF APRIL 30, 1951, FOR NEW PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION, SINCE THE.PRESI­DENT HAS NOT YET APPROVED A DETAILED MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM FOR FISCAL YEAR 1952.

IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF RECOMMENDED THE MILITARY FORCES THAT THEY FELT THIS NATION MUST HAVE BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 1952 IN ORDER TO MEET THE MINIMUM SECURITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS.","WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET HE HAS SUBJECTED THESE ESTIMATES TO A SEARCHING REVIEW FOR A PERIOD OF 2 MONTHS, TO BE SURE THAT THEY FINANCED ONLY MINIMUM NEEDS IN LINE WITH THE ARMY'S PREPAREDNESS OBJECTIVES AND THAT THE PROPER BALANCE HAD BEEN MAINTAINED BETWEEN THE ARMY'S URGENT IMMEDIATE REQUIRE­MENTS AND ITS POTENTIAL LONG-TERM NEEDS.","TURNING FROM MY PREPARED STATEMENT, ONE OF THE THINGS I ALWAYS HOPED FOR AS DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET WAS THAT THERE COULD BE A REVIEW AND ANALYSIS INTERNALLY OF THE SERVICES' BUDGETS BY REPRE­SENTATIVES OF THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RATHER THAN THE MORE FORMAL PROCEEDING OF NOT MOVING THE BUDGET INTO THE PICTURE UNTIL AFTER THE CONCLUSION HAD BEEN REACHED IN THE AREA OF THE SERVICES' OPERATION.","IF WE WERE TO UNDERTAKE TO OBTAIN MATERIEL AS FAST AS OUR FACTORIES COULD MAKE IT AND AT THE SAME TIME WERE WILLING TO ASSUME THE FAR GREATER DOLLAR COST INVOLVED IN SUCH A PROGRAM, WE COULD BE READY FOR WAR AT AN EARLIER DATE.","MINDFUL OF THE RISKS INVOLVED, THE ARMY IN THE BUDGET NOW BEFORE YOU HAS ACCEPTED A PROGRAM WHICH EMPHASIZES THE CREATION OF A PRO­DUCTION BASE AND ITS MAINTENANCE DURING THE INDEFINITE PERIOD OF MILITARY PREPAREDNESS THAT LIES AHEAD.","MILITARY FORCES AND PERSONNEL

PRODUCTION BASE.",I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE FUNDS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION TO BE REQUESTED BY THE ARMY FOR THE COMING FISCAL YEAR REPRESENT ONLY A PARTIAL FUNDING OF OUR TOTAL MILITARY CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS AND THAT THEY INCLUDE ONLY THE MINIMUM AMOUNT NEEDED DURING THE COMING FISCAL YEAR TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL ADDITIONAL FACILITIES.,"THE DETAILS OF THE PRESENT BUDGET AND AN ANALYSIS OF MILITARY REQUIRE­

WISH TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE IN THE ARMY ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE IMPLI­
CATIONS UPON THE NATIONAL ECONOMY OF THESE LARGE EXPENDITURES NECES­
SARY FOR DEFENSE.","1 MUST EMPHASIZE AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THAT 
THE UNPREDICTABLE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION HAS EVEN GREATER IMPLICATIONS

STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY POSTURE.",THE NEXT QUESTION WHICH WAS ASKED IS WHAT DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THIS BUDGET IS INCLUDED FOR WAR RESERVES.,"WE, OF COURSE, HAVE RECOGNIZED THE NECESSITY OF PROVIDING FUNDS FOR EXPEDITING PRODUCTION, BUT WE ARE EXTREMELY ANXIOUS THAT THAT PRACTICE BE STOPPED JUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OF DEFENSE.","OF COURSE, WE DO NOT WANT TO STRIP OURSELVES OF NECESSARY DEFENSE, BUT WHEN BILLS ARE ON THE FLOOR THERE IS A DISPOSITION TO OFFER AMENDMENTS AND TRY TO PERFECT THEM-SO THEY SAY-AND THERE MIGHT CONCEIVABLY BE A MOTION MADE TO CUT THIS BILL BY 10 PERCENT, 15 PERCENT, OR 5 PERCENT.","IT HAS BEEN EXAMINED NOT ONLY ORIGINALLY AT OUR OWN CONTROL LEVEL BUT IT HAS BEEN EXAMINED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE LEVEL, AND IT HAS BEEN EXAMINED BY THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ELIMINATING DUPLICATIONS, PLANNING ON THE UTILIZATION OF MANPOWER, AND SO FORTH.","YET, THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET AND THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY AND THE OTHER SERVICES HAVE SCALED THIS DOWN TO ABOUT $60 BILLION.","SOME 20 PERCENT, I BELIEVE, OF THESE COSTS GO TO EITHER PAYING OR SUB­
SISTING OR GIVING THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE, AS OUR MOTHERS AND BROTHERS OF

MAHON DID, ALTHOUGH I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION IN MY MIND, NAMELY: IN VIEW OF THE SIZE OF THE BUDGET THAT IS INVOLVED, IN VIEW OF THE HUGE MASS OF DETAILS NECESSARY TO THE BUDGET MAKE-UP, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS RELATING THERETO, I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A STATEMENT FROM YOU-IF YOU CANNOT GIVE IT NOW, TO BE FURNISHED LATER-I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE, IF THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD DECIDE TO DECREASE THE BUDGET BY THE FOLLOWING FOUR AMOUNTS-HALF A BILLION DOLLARS, $1 BILLION, WHICH WOULD BE 5 PERCENT, $1%BILLION WHICH WOULD BE 7.5 PERCENT, OR $2 BILLION WHICH WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 10 PER-CENT-WHERE COULD THOSE CUTS BE TAKEN WITH THE LEAST HURT TO THE MILITARY PROGRAM?","(THE MATTER REFERRED TO FOLLOWS:) THE ARMY'S BUDGET WAS CAREFULLY PREPARED AND BASED ON A BALANCED PROGRAM, THAT IS, COMBAT UNITS WITH THEIR REQUIRED SUPPORTING UNITS, LOGISTIC SUPPORT, AND BASIC ESTABLISHMENT.","ANY REDUCTION IN FUNDS OF THE MAGNITUDE UNDER CONSIDERATION WILL RESULT IN AN IMBALANCE OF FQRCES, AND WOULD AFFECT ALL PHASES OF THE ARMY PROGRAMS; HOW­EVER, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN COMBAT AND SUPPORTING UNITS.","IF THE REDUCTION IN FUNDS WERE APPLIED SOLELY TO MILITARY UNITS, A ONE-HALF BILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION WOULD RESULT IN THE ELIMINATION OF ONE DIVISION

THIS IS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 16 PERCENT OVER 1951. THE INCREASE IS DUE TO: EXTENDED MAINTENANCE IN STORAGE AND INSPECTION OF MATERIEL FOR REPLENISHMENT ISSUE TO THE EXPANDED ARMY; INCREASED REPLENISHMENT OF SPARE PARTS, RESULTING FROM THE NEEDS OF THE EXPANDED ARMY AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS OF SPARE PARTS; INCREASE IN UTILIZATION OF LIGHT AIRCRAFT, WITH THE RESULTANT ACTIVATION OF ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT MAIN­TENANCE UNITS; INCREASE IN THE ACTIVITY OF ORDNANCE PROCUREMENT DIS­TRICTS IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE EXPANDED PROCUREMENT PROGRAM; AND ADDITIONAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND TRAINING AIDS DUE TO EXPANSION OF THE ARMY AND TO THE NEW TYPES OF MATERIEL BEING PROCURED FOR ISSUE
